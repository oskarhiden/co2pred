Rebars - Poland region 1,Bygg,"Stål-, aluminiumskonstruksjoner",,SE,"The underlying inventory is based on data from 2018 and specific inventory data from all reinforcement workshops has been used. For each region, an average value has been calculated taking into account quantities delivered from the region during 2018. For electrical steel manufacturing and hot rolling, the LCA calculations have been based either on data from EPDs (which are then classified as representative of the product), or data from the specific supplier, in the form of the percentage of secondary steel. For those steel mills that also reported energy use, these data have been used to parameterize an otherwise conservative general inventory process for the steel production and the hot rolling. These processes conservative process data are based on inventories from ecoinvent that have been made conservative with regard to average data from 2010 (i.e. the data is inherently older). Generally, in the inventory, specific transport distances have been used and representative utilisation rates and vehicles types. In all manufacturing processes, national electricity mixes have been used (module A1-A3). Apart from process data for electric arc furnace and hot rolling, inventory data from GABI is used. A weighted assessment of the proportion of product-specific data representative of the declared reinforcement is 95%, where EPD data is simplified classified as product-specific measured data).

Steel sheet piles made from hot rolled steel,Bygg,"Stål-, aluminiumskonstruksjoner",,CN,"Data quality:  General requirements and guidelines concerning use of generic and specific data and the quality of those are as described in EN 15804:  2012+A1:2013, clause 6.3.6 and 6.3.7. The data is representative according to temporal, geographical and technological requirements.  Databases used have been ecoinvent v3.4 and World Steel Association LCI data which is found in the Industry data 2.0 ecoinvent extension  (See also Worldsteel, 2017). Calculations have been carried out using Simapro v8.5.  Temporal  Data for use in module A3 is supplied by the manufacturer and consists of recorded and calculated amounts of specific material and energy  consumption for the site. Specific data has been collected for 2018. Generic data has been created or updated within the last 10 years. Any  exceptions are documented in the LCA-report.  Geographical  The geographic region of the site included in the calculation is Norway (A3 - storage). Region specific worldsteel LCIs are used to model the  raw material supply (A1).  Technological  Data represents technology in use.    Cut-off criteria:  All major raw materials and all the essential energy is included. The production process for raw materials and energy flows that are included  with very small amounts (<1%) are not included. This cut-off rule does not apply for hazardous materials and substances.     Allocation:  Incoming energy and water and waste production in-house is allocated following EN 15804 and is distributed equally among all products  through mass allocation. Worldsteel LCIs used are not fully compliant with EN15804 because allocation has been avoided by system  expansion for some steelmaking co-products (see Worldsteel (2017) for a justification for this deviation). A sensitivity analysis provided by  worldsteel (2017) shows that the use of system expansion does not greatly affect the chosen impact parameters; GWP increases 3%-7%  depending on the steel type, while primary energy demand is reduced somewhat. In this study, a very small positive ODP result in module D is  caused by this allocation approach.

Geographical:  The geographic region of the site included in the calculation is Norway (A3 - storage). Region specific worldsteel LCIs are used to model the  raw material supply (A1).  Technological:  Data represents technology in use.    Allocation:  Incoming energy and water and waste production in-house is allocated following EN 15804 and is distributed equally among all products  through mass allocation. Worldsteel LCIs used are not fully compliant with EN15804 because allocation has been avoided by system  expansion for some steelmaking co-products (see Worldsteel (2017) for a justification for this deviation). A sensitivity analysis provided by  worldsteel (2017) shows that the use of system expansion does not greatly affect the chosen impact parameters; GWP increases 3%-7%  depending on the steel type, while primary energy demand is reduced somewhat.

The reason we can use a mass basis is because we use the exact same manufacturing process shown for every product. We only produce glass mineral wool in the Billesholm site using the same process and therefore all the factors can be allocated by a mass basis. The amount of binder varies for different products and is accounted for as well as if different surface layers are used. A mass balance was conducted for the 2018 production year to ensure that we have not excluded any materials, emissions and hence potential environmental impacts. Regarding the mass balance, all the raw materials and corresponding production goods and wastes generated were taken into account.

The production site of Saint-Gobain Sweden AB, ISOVER in Billesholm, uses a small amount of natural and abundant raw materials (sand, soda, limestone, feldspar) and high share of recycled glass cullets (more than 50% post-consumer recycled content of the glass). This material is converted by using fusion and fiberizing techniques to produce glass wool. The products obtained come in the form of a glass wool pipe section. On Earth, naturally, the best insulator is dry immobile air at 10°C: its thermal conductivity factor, expressed in ?, is 0.025 W/(m.K) (watts per meter Kelvin degree). The thermal conductivity of mineral wool at 10°C is close to immobile air as its lambda varies from 0.030 W/(m.K) for the most efficient to 0.040 W/(m.K). For technical insulation the thermal conductivity is declared for different temperatures. With its entangled structure, glass wool is a porous material that traps the air, making it one of the best insulating materials. The porous and elastic structure of the wool also absorbs noise in the air and offers acoustic correction inside premises. Glass wool mainly containing incombustible materials and does not react to fire. Glass wool insulation is used in buildings as well as industrial facilities.

For every thickness, use a multiplication factor in order to obtain the environmental performance of every thickness. In order to calculate the multiplication factors, a reference unit has been selected (value of R= 1.00 m2K/W for 31 mm). The various multiplication factors are obtained by making the LCA calculations for all thicknesses, including packaging. In the table below the multiplication factors are shown for products and specific thickness of the product family. In order to obtain the environmental performance associated with every specific product and thickness, the results expressed in this EPD must be multiplied by its corresponding multiplication factor. Such factor is based on GWP indicator and should be used as a proxy for the rest of indicator showed in this EPD.

The unfaced and uncoated synthetic resin-bonded stone wool materials described in this declaration are produced in the form of batts, slabs or rolls for use in building applications in the density range from 30 up to 70 kg/m³. ROCKWOOL® stone wool is a non-combustible material that does not react to fire. Stone wool’s built-in fire protection is natural and not dependent on flame retardants. Stone wool withstands temperatures exceeding 1,000 degrees Celsius, and retains its fire performance throughout its lifetime. The insulation properties of stone wool is primarily achieved by the immobile air within in the open structure of the product. Therefore, the declared insulation property will remain constant for the declared lifetime of the product.

It is a polymer foam, consisting of air-filled polystyrene cells.  EPS is manufactured through permeating polystyrene beads with pentane, allowing the beads to expand when exposed to steam. This addition of a so-called blowing agent adds 4% - 6% w/w.  The expanded polystyrene (EPS) beads are then fed into a block molding machine, where steam and pressure forms large blocks of EPS. The amount of EPS going into the mold determines the densitiy of the block, where pressure class 80 provides a density at 80 kN/m2, which is approximately 15 kg/m3. After molding, the remaining blowing agent, pentane, is aired out and the blocks are cut into the desired shape.

For every thickness, use a multiplication factor in order to obtain the environmental performance of every thickness. Using the thickness factor will for some indicators give higher values than calculated for the specific thickness in GaBi. In order to calculate the multiplication factors, a reference unit has been selected (value of R= 1,00 m2K/W for 35 mm). Multiplication factors are obtained by making the LCA calculations for all thicknesses, including packaging.

The intended use of the EPD is to communicate quantified environmental impacts of construction products for application in the assessment of the environmental performance of buildings. ROCKWOOL® stone wool thermal insulation is a durable and firesafe insulation material that can be used to insulate against against heat, cold, fire, vibrations and noise. ROCKWOOL® stone wool is made primarily from abundantly available volcanic rock, an increasing proportion of recycled ROCKWOOL® stone wool material and a cured resin binder. Other materials utilised in the production of ROCKWOOL® stone wool are by-products from other industries. Since 2012, ROCKWOOL® has been offering a take back system for closed loop recycling – Rockcycle. The products covered by this declaration are ROCKWOOL® Granulate thermal insulation produced for the Nordic market (Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Finland). The unfaced and uncoated synthetic resin-bonded stone wool materials described in this declaration are produced in the form of granulate. The density of the product as installed can vary according to end use insulation requirements. Typical density as installed is within 28-70 kg/m3. ROCKWOOL® stone wool is a non-combustible material that does not react to fire. Stone wool’s built-in fire protection is natural and not dependent on flame retardants. Stone wool withstands temperatures exceeding 1,000 degrees Celsius, and retains its fire performance throughout its lifetime. The insulation properties of stone wool is primarily achieved by the immobile air within in the open structure of the product. Therefore, the declared insulation property will remain constant for the declared lifetime of the product. This also allows the product to absorb noise and sounds and contribute to a better indoor acoustic climate. ROCKWOOL® stone wool fibers are proven to be safe to manufacture, install and live with.

Please use the conversion table below for other sizes than the declared unit. No variation between sites; single production site declared. Product description Expanded polystyrene (EPS) is a common material used for thermal insulation of buildings, including floors, walls and ceilings. It is a polymer foam, consisting of air-filled polystyrene cells. As 98% of the material is air, EPS provides good insulating properties at a low weight. Other characteristics of the material include low moisture absorption, long service life and high compressive strength. EPS is manufactured through permeating polystyrene beads with pentane, allowing the beads to expand when exposed to steam. This addition of a so-called blowing agent adds 4% - 6% w/w. The expanded polystyrene (EPS) beads are then fed into a block molding machine, where steam and pressure forms large blocks of EPS. The amount of EPS going into the mold determines the densitiy of the block, where pressure class 80 provides a density at 80 kN/m2, which is approximately 15 kg/m3. After molding, the remaining blowing agent, pentane, is aired out and the blocks are cut into the desired shape. Weight per declared unit is  0,57 kg given a density of 15 kg/cubic meter with a thickness of 38 mm.

For every thickness, use a multiplication factor in order to obtain the environmental performance of every thickness. In order to calculate the multiplication factors, a reference unit has been selected (value of R= 1.00 m2K/W for 31 mm). The various multiplication factors are obtained by making the LCA calculations for all thicknesses, including packaging. In the table below the multiplication factors are shown for products and specific thickness of the product family. In order to obtain the environmental performance associated with every specific product and thickness, the results expressed in this EPD must be multiplied by its corresponding multiplication factor. Such factor is based on GWP indicator and should be used as a proxy for the rest of indicator showed in this EPD.

ISOVER SC Roll 16 Alu1,Bygg,Isolasjon,,FI,"Allocation criteria are based on mass. The allocation of all the air emissions, wastes and energy usage are based on mass (kg). The reason we can use a mass basis is because we use the exact same manufacturing process shown for every product. We only produce glass mineral wool in the Hyvinkää and Forssa sites using the same process and therefore all the factors can be allocated by a mass basis. The amount of binder varies for different products and is accounted for as well as if different surface layers are used. A mass balance was conducted for the 2018 production year to ensure that we have not excluded any materials, emissions and hence potential environmental impacts. Regarding the mass balance, all the raw materials and corresponding production goods and wastes generated were taken into account.   The cut-off criterion used in Saint-Gobain EPD will be the mass criterion with the following details: - Taking into account all input and output flows in a unit process i.e. taking into account the value of all flows in the unit process and the corresponding LCI whenever available - No simplification of the LCI by additional exclusions of material flows Data collected at the manufacturing site was used. The inventory process in this LCA includes all data related to raw material, packaging material and consumable items, and the associated transport to the manufacturing site. Process energy and water use, direct production waste and emissions to air and water are included. Scenarios have been developed to account for downstream processes such as demolition and waste treatment in accordance with the requirements of EN 15804:2012+A1:2013 All inputs and outputs to the manufacturing plants have been included and made transparent.

ISOVER glass wool products are CE-labelled according to EN 14303 (2009) “Thermal Insulation Products for Building Equipment and Industrial Installations. Factory made mineral wool (MW) Products. Specification”, and EN 13172 (2012) “Thermal Insulation Products – Evaluation of Conformity” The production site of Saint-Gobain Finland Oy / ISOVER in Forssa Finland, use a small amount of natural and abundant raw materials (sand, soda, limestone, feldspar) and a high share of recycled glass cullets (more than 70 % of external glass cullets). This material is converted by using fusion and fiberizing techniques to produce glass wool. The products obtained come in the form of ""mineral wool slabs, rolls or lamellas"" consisting of a soft, airy structure. On Earth, naturally, the best insulator is dry immobile air at 10 °C: its thermal conductivity factor, expressed in ?, is 0.025 W/(mK) (watts per meter Kelvin degree). The thermal conductivity of mineral wool is close to immobile air as its lambda varies from 0.030 W/(mK) for the most efficient, to 0.040 W/ (mK) to the least efficient. With its entangled structure, glass wool is a porous material that traps the air, making it one of the best insulating materials. The porous and elastic structure of the wool also absorbs airborne noise, impact noise and offers acoustic correction inside premises. Glass wool containing incombustible materials does not react to fire. Glass wool insulation is used in buildings as well as industrial facilities. It ensures a high level of comfort and minimizes carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by preventing heat loss through roofs, walls, floors, pipes and boilers. It reduces noise and protects homes and industrial facilities against fire.

Allocation criteria are based on mass. The allocation of all the air emissions, wastes and energy usage are based on mass (kg). The reason we can use a mass basis is because we use the exact same manufacturing process shown for every product. We only produce glass mineral wool at the Vamdrup site using the same process and therefore all the factors can be allocated by a mass basis. The amount of binder varies for different products, and is accounted for. A mass balance was conducted for the 2018 production year to ensure that we haven’t excluded any materials, emissions and hence potential environmental impacts. Regarding the mass balance, all the raw materials and corresponding production goods and wastes generated were taken into account.  The cut-off criterion used in Saint-Gobain EPD will be the mass criterion with the following details: - Taking into account all input and output flows in a unit process i.e. taking into account the value of all flows in the unit process and the corresponding LCI whenever available - No simplification of the LCI by additional exclusions of material flows Data collected at the manufacturing site was used. The inventory process in this LCA includes all data related to raw material, packaging material and consumable items, and the associated transport to the manufacturing site. Process energy and water use, direct production waste and emissions to air and water are included. Scenarios have been developed to account for downstream processes such as demolition and waste treatment in accordance with the requirements of EN 15804:2012+A1:2013 All inputs and outputs to the manufacturing plants have been included and made transparent. All assumptions regarding the materials and water balances have also been included. All hazardous and toxic materials and substances are considered in the inventory even though they are below the cut off criteria. There are excluded processes in the inventory: - Flows related to human activities, such as employee transport and administration activity, are according to the PCR not accounted for.

On Earth, naturally, the best insulator is dry immobile air at 10 °C: its thermal conductivity factor, expressed in ?, is 0,025 W/(mK) (watts per meter Kelvin degree). The thermal conductivity of mineral wool is close to immobile air as its lambda varies from 0,030 W/(mK) for the most efficient, to 0,040 W/ (mK) to the least efficient. With its entangled structure, glass wool is a porous material that traps the air, making it one of the best insulating materials. The porous and elastic structure of the wool also absorbs airborne noise, impact noise and offers acoustic correction inside premises. Glass wool containing incombustible materials does not react to fire. Glass wool insulation is used in buildings as well as industrial facilities. It ensures a high level of comfort and minimizes carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by preventing heat loss through roofs, walls, floors, pipes and boilers. It reduces noise and protects homes and industrial facilities against fire.

With its entangled structure, glass wool is a porous material that traps the air, making it one of the best insulating materials. The porous and elastic structure of the wool also absorbs airborne noise, impact noise and offers acoustic correction inside premises. Glass wool containing incombustible materials does not react to fire. Glass wool insulation is used in buildings as well as industrial facilities. It ensures a high level of comfort and minimizes carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by preventing heat loss through roofs, walls, floors, pipes and boilers. It reduces noise and protects homes and industrial facilities against fire. Correctly installed glass wool products and solutions do not require maintenance and last throughout the lifetime of the building (which is set at 60 years as a default value in the model), or as long as the insulated building component is a part of the building.

For every thickness, use a multiplication factor in order to obtain the environmental performance of every thickness. In order to calculate the multiplication factors, a reference unit has been selected (value of R= 1.00 m2K/W for 35 mm). The various multiplication factors are obtained by making the LCA calculations for all thicknesses, including packaging. In the table below the multiplication factors are shown for products and specific thickness of the product family. In order to obtain the environmental performance associated with every specific product and thickness, the results expressed in this EPD must be multiplied by its corresponding multiplication factor.

For every thickness, use a multiplication factor in order to obtain the environmental performance of every thickness. Using the thickness factor will for some indicators give higher values than calculated for the specific thickness in GaBi. In order to calculate the multiplication factors, a reference unit has been selected (value of R= 1,00 m2K/W for 37 mm). Multiplication factors are obtained by making the LCA calculations for all thicknesses, including packaging.

On Earth, naturally, the best insulator is dry immobile air at 10 °C: its thermal conductivity factor, expressed in ?, is 0.025 W/(mK) (watts per meter Kelvin degree). The thermal conductivity of mineral wool is close to immobile air as its lambda varies from 0.030 W/(mK) for the most efficient, to 0.040 W/ (mK) to the least efficient. With its entangled structure, glass wool is a porous material that traps the air, making it one of the best insulating materials. The porous and elastic structure of the wool also absorbs airborne noise, impact noise and offers acoustic correction inside premises. Glass wool containing incombustible materials does not react to fire. Glass wool insulation is used in buildings as well as industrial facilities. It ensures a high level of comfort and minimizes carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by preventing heat loss through roofs, walls, floors, pipes and boilers. It reduces noise and protects homes and industrial facilities against fire. Correctly installed glass wool products and solutions do not require maintenance and last throughout the lifetime of the building (which is set at 60 years as a default value in the model), or as long as the insulated building component is a part of the building.

Allocation criteria are based on mass. The allocation of all the air emissions, wastes and energy usage are based on mass (kg). The reason we can use a mass basis is because we use the exact same manufacturing process shown for every product. We only produce glass mineral wool at the Vamdrup site using the same process and therefore all the factors can be allocated by a mass basis. The amount of binder varies for different products, and is accounted for. A mass balance was conducted for the 2018 production year to ensure that we haven’t excluded any materials, emissions and hence potential environmental impacts. Regarding the mass balance, all the raw materials and corresponding production goods and wastes generated were taken into account.    The cut-off criterion used in Saint-Gobain EPD will be the mass criterion with the following details: - Taking into account all input and output flows in a unit process i.e. taking into account the value of all flows in the unit process and the corresponding LCI whenever available - No simplification of the LCI by additional exclusions of material flows Data collected at the manufacturing site was used.

ISOVER SC Floor Slab,Bygg,Isolasjon,,FI,"Allocation criteria are based on mass. The allocation of all the air emissions, wastes and energy usage are based on mass (kg). The reason we can use a mass basis is because we use the exact same manufacturing process shown for every product. We only produce glass mineral wool in the Hyvinkää and Forssa sites using the same process and therefore all the factors can be allocated by a mass basis. The amount of binder varies for different products and is accounted for as well as if different surface layers are used. A mass balance was conducted for the 2018 production year to ensure that we have not excluded any materials, emissions and hence potential environmental impacts. Regarding the mass balance, all the raw materials and corresponding production goods and wastes generated were taken into account.  The cut-off criterion used in Saint-Gobain EPD will be the mass criterion with the following details: - Taking into account all input and output flows in a unit process i.e. taking into account the value of all flows in the unit process and the corresponding LCI whenever available - No simplification of the LCI by additional exclusions of material flows Data collected at the manufacturing site was used.

Product description Expanded polystyrene (EPS) is a common material used for thermal insulation of buildings, including floors, walls and ceilings. It is a polymer foam, consisting of air-filled polystyrene cells. As 98% of the material is air, EPS provides good insulating properties at a low weight. Other characteristics of the material include low moisture absorption, long service life and high compressive strength. EPS is manufactured through permeating polystyrene beads with pentane, allowing the beads to expand when exposed to steam. This addition of a so-called blowing agent adds 4% - 6% w/w. The expanded polystyrene (EPS) beads are then fed into a block molding machine, where steam and pressure forms large blocks of EPS. The amount of EPS going into the mold determines the densitiy of the block, where pressure class 80 provides a density at 80 kN/m2, which is approximately 16 kg/m3. After molding, the remaining blowing agent, pentane, is aired out and the blocks are cut into the desired shape.

The thermal conductivity of mineral wool is close to immobile air as its lambda varies from 0,030 W/(mK) for the most efficient, to 0,040 W/ (mK) to the least efficient. With its entangled structure, glass wool is a porous material that traps the air, making it one of the best insulating materials. The porous and elastic structure of the wool also absorbs airborne noise, impact noise and offers acoustic correction inside premises. Glass wool containing incombustible materials does not react to fire. Glass wool insulation is used in buildings as well as industrial facilities. It ensures a high level of comfort and minimizes carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by preventing heat loss through roofs, walls, floors, pipes and boilers. It reduces noise and protects homes and industrial facilities against fire. Correctly installed glass wool products and solutions do not require maintenance, and last throughout the lifetime of the building (which is set at 60 years as a default value in the model), or as long as the insulated building component is a part of the building.

Because of the low weight and high compressive strength the block are used to minimize the pressure of the construction over the geofoam down to the masses below.   This product is tested for 5% compressive strength. EPS is manufactured through permeating polystyrene beads with pentane, allowing the beads to expand when exposed to steam. This addition of a so-called blowing agent adds 4% - 6% w/w.  The expanded polystyrene (EPS) beads are then fed into a block molding machine, where steam and pressure forms large blocks of EPS. The amount of EPS going into the mold determines the densitiy of the block, where pressure class 100 provides a density at 100 kN/m2, which is approximately 20 kg/m3.
