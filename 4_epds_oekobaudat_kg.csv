Steel sheet hot dip galvanized (2-20mm),Metalle,Stahl und Eisen,Stahlbleche,DE,This data set has been modeled according to the European Standard EN 15804 for Sustainable Building. Results are depicted in modules that allow the structured expression of results over the entire life cycle.,No,en,"The data set represents the steel production in Germany based on the main production steps which take place within an integrated steel plant. These production steps as well as the main upstream process steps are described in the following.  The main primary products are iron ore, pellets and hard coal. The import mix for the German steel production concerning iron ore and pellets is: Canada 50%, Brazil 25%, Australia 25%. The import mix for the German steel production concerning hard coal is: 100% Canada. The iron ore mining is explained in detail in the respective documentation file (please see link below). The preparation of the iron ore includes mainly the crushing. The average iron content in the iron ore is 60%. Pellets are small crystallized balls of iron ore. The pelletisation process consists of grinding and drying, balling and induration followed by screening and handling. The provision of hard coal is described in the respective documentation file (please see link below).  For every fraction the transport to Germany is considered in the data set. The transportation includes all necessary transportation means like ship and where required railway.  The coke oven produces as main product coke out of hard coal. The main by-product resulting from this operation is coke oven gas (COG gas) which is used as energy carrier within the steel production. Further by-products as tar, benzene and sulphur are sold and therefore excluded from the system by allocation to (net) calorific value.  In the sinter plant sinter feed is produced based on the major inputs coke, iron ore and additives. Sintering is an agglomeration process which takes place under high temperatures. The raw materials (fine iron ore, coke breeze, additives) are blended, then the coke breeze is ignited. The result of the sinter process is the so-called sinter cake which has to be broken up, screened and cooled down.  The blast furnace is a closed system into which iron bearing materials (iron ore lump, sinter and / or pellets), additives (slag formers such as limestone) and reducing agents (coke) are continuously fed from the top of the furnace shaft through a charging system. A hot air blast, enriched with oxygen and auxiliary reducing agents (e.g. pulverized coal) is injected providing a counter-current of reducing gases. The air blast reacts with the reducing agents to produce mainly carbon monoxide which in turn reduces iron oxides to metal iron. The main products of the blast furnace operation are hot metal, blast furnace gas (BF gas) and blast furnace slag (BF slag). The BF gas is used as fuel for heating comparable to the COG gas or for electricity production.  The objective in oxygen steelmaking is to burn (i.e., oxidise) the undesirable impurities contained in the metallic feedstock. The main elements thus converted into oxides are carbon, silicon, manganese, phosphorus and sulphur. The purpose of this oxidation process, therefore, are to reduce the carbon content to a specified level to adjust the contents of desirable foreign elements and to remove undesirable impurities to the greatest possible extent. The production of steel by the basic oxygen furnace (BOF) process is a discontinuous process which involves the following steps: transfer and storage of hot metal, pre-treatment of hot metal (desulphurisation), oxidation in the BOF (decarburisation and oxidation of impurities) and secondary metallurgical treatment (e.g. vacuum treatment and adding alloying elements). Within the main step of the oxygen steelmaking, the hot metal feeds together with steel scrap the converter. The main products of the converter are the liquid steel, the converter gas or basic oxygen furnace gas (BOF gas) and the BOF slag. The gas is as well used as energy carrier within the steel production.  Afterwards the continuous casting takes place whereby the liquid steel is cast in continuous strand. The output of the continuous casting process is the slab.  The following operations are two rolling processes: the hot strip mill and the cold rolling mill. In the hot rolling mill the slab is reshaped above the recrystallization temperature. The qualities obtained in this process are e.g. strength and surface quality. During the rolling process the material passes through the furnace and the rolling line. In the furnace the metal is preheated by natural gas. There is no need for an additional warming, if the hot slabs are directly charged into the rolling mill. The forming is done in various rolling frames until the final shape is obtained. The steel scrap in this process are directly recycled.  In the hot rolling mill the material is reshaped.   Background system: Electricity: Electricity is modelled according to the individual country-specific situations. The country-specific modelling is achieved on multiple levels. Firstly, individual energy carrier specific power plants and plants for renewable energy sources are modelled according to the current national electricity grid mix.

The major feed stock for the EAF is ferrous scrap, which may comprise of scrap from inside the steelworks (e.g. cut-offs), cut-offs from steel product manufacturers (e.g. vehicle builders) and post-consumer scrap (e.g. end of life products). As in the integrated steel plant including blast furnaces and converters, a slag is formed from lime to collect undesirable components in the steel. Thus lime is an additive as well as coal (carbon) as reducing agent. Oxygen lances and / or oxy-fuel burners are used to assist in the early stages of melting.  For every material fraction the transport is considered in the data set.   For the production of carbon steel and low alloyed steels, following main operations are performed: raw material handling and storage, furnace charging with/without scrap preheating, EAF scrap melting, steel and slag tapping, ladle furnace treatments for quality adjustment, slag handling and finally continuous casting. The output of the continuous casting is the steel slab.  Afterwards the slab is manufactured in a wire drawing process. The main property of reinforced steel is its bond with the surrounded concrete.

Background system: Electricity: Electricity from renewable and non- renewable powerplants is modelled so that it represents a countrys specific consumption mix including transmission / distribution losses, own consumption, imports, emissions and efficiency standards, and energy carrier properties. Several factors are taken into account. (1) Energy carrier production - The exploration, mining / production, processing, and transportation of energy carrier supply chains are modelled for each country. The models account for differences among countries in production and processing, including crude oil production technologies, flaring rates, production efficiencies, emissions, etc. (2) Energy carrier supply - Each countrys specific energy carrier supply is modelled, taking into account domestic supply versus imports from abroad. Energy carrier properties (e.g. carbon and energy content), which can vary depending from where an energy carrier is sourced, are adjusted accordingly. (3) Power plants - Models are created to represent energy carrier-specific power plants and electricity generation facilities specific to different renewable energy resources. Energy carrier production and supply models are used to represent power plant inputs. Combined heat and power (CHP) plants are also considered.

The combined action of the aluminum and the zinc gives extraordinary corrosion resistance to this type of coating, where the first creates a protection barrier whilst the latter becomes the sacrificing element providing galvanic protection. Among its most important characteristics are high reflectivity, which generates higher thermal efficiency, and high heat resistance with no loss of protection, brilliance and colouring characteristics.

The Galvalume® basic composition is: 55% aluminum, 43.4% zinc and 1.6% silicon. The single operation production process occurs in ArcelorMittal Vega which can produce coated coils in thickness varying from 0.40 to 2.3mm and several widths depending on the steel grade. The coating process can apply various thickness Galvalume® coated steels are described according to NBR 15578. They are available in a very wide range of steel grades and coating density of 3.8 g/cm3. Specific mechanical properties are defined for each steel grade used as substrate. The product is manufactured through the blast furnace-basic oxygen furnace (BF-BOF) route. Coke and iron ore (normally sinter produced from iron ore and limestone) are both fed into the blast furnace from the top; simultaneously, hot air and pulverised coal or natural gas (hydrogen is experimentally being used) are injected through pipes in the side of the lower part of the furnace called tuyeres. This results in a counter-cyclical process of descending iron ore met by rising reducing gases. Lime fluxes and other additives are also used in the blast furnace in varying quantities to control the level of impurities and the temperature. The blast furnace produces molten iron (“hot metal”) at temperatures up to 1400-1 500°C. The hot metal is then fed to the BOF, often in conjunction with some scrap, where oxygen is injected to lower the carbon content from approximately 4-5% to the required level of carbon for the steel grade produced. The produced liquid steel is then refined in a ladle furnace with addition of ferroalloys and metals to obtain the required steel characteristics. The steel is then casted at a continuous caster to obtain semi-finished products such as billets, blooms or slabs. The following operations are two rolling processes: the hot strip mill and the cold rolling mill. In the hot rolling mill the slab is reshaped above the recrystallization temperature. The qualities obtained in this process are e.g. strength and surface quality. During the rolling process the material passes through the furnace and the rolling line. In the furnace the metal is preheated by natural gas. There is no need for an additional warming, if the hot slabs are directly charged into the rolling mill. The forming is done in various rolling frames until the final shape is obtained. The steel scrap in this process are directly recycled. In the cold rolling mill the material is reshaped below the recrystallization temperature. Thereby a enhanced surface quality, an improved dimensional accuracy as well as a higher strength are achieved. The different process steps are: pickling, the rolling line and the heat treatment. The rolled coil can be then metallic coated with Zinc, Aluminium and Silicium.

Results are depicted in modules that allow the structured expression of results over the entire life cycle.,No,en,"Chimneys of stainless steel.  For chimneys of stainless steel an average life span of 30 years is assumed. It is expected, that the recycling quote of big appliances like boilers, air conditioning, and ventilation systems is 95%.

For mineral materials like mineral wool, concrete or ceramics inert landfilling is assumed, as well as for 5-10% of metals and plastics (e.g. cable waste and pipe pieces) that are not recycled. Plastics that are not recycled are introduced to the municipal waste incineration. For the MWI a European model with average emission values and energy production rates was used. Depending on the incinerated type of plastic, different processes with corresponding elemental compositions were used. Then dataset were set up in collaboration with the Confederation of European Waste-to-Energy Plants (CEWEP) and are available on the website of the European Platform on LCA [EC 2008].

The extraction of the main raw material from the quarry normally takes place in the immediate area of the cement works.  Portland cement (CEM I) is primarily made up of finely ground clinker cement and a smaller amount of ground materials. Other cements may also include constituents such as slag sand (CEM III), natural puzzolan such as trass (CEM IV), fly ash, oil shale burn-out or limestone. The most important agent is the blast furnace cement (CEM III).  Coagulation is controlled with the help of minor constituents, such as calcium sulphate to facilitate its optimal processing in the concrete production.  Clinker cement is made up of a mixture of primary products of mainly calcium oxide, silica, aluminium oxide, and iron oxide. Limestone, chalk and clay (or their naturally occurring mixture of limestone marl) provide these chemical constituents.   The raw material mixture is heated to approximately 1450°C in a rotary furnace until sintering. New bonds are created from the source material, these are known as the clinker phases.

Steel forging part,Metalle,Stahl und Eisen,Guss- und Schmiedeteile aus Stahl und Eisen,DE,This data set has been modeled according to the European Standard EN 15804 for Sustainable Building. Results are depicted in modules that allow the structured expression of results over the entire life cycle.,No,en,"The data set represents the steel production in Germany based on the main production steps which take place within an integrated steel plant. These production steps as well as the main upstream process steps are described in the following.  The main primary products are iron ore, pellets and hard coal. The import mix for the German steel production concerning iron ore and pellets is: Canada 50%, Brazil 25%, Australia 25%. The import mix for the German steel production concerning hard coal is: 100% Canada. The iron ore mining is explained in detail in the respective documentation file (please see link below). The preparation of the iron ore includes mainly the crushing. The average iron content in the iron ore is 60%. Pellets are small crystallized balls of iron ore. The pelletisation process consists of grinding and drying, balling and induration followed by screening and handling. The provision of hard coal is described in the respective documentation file (please see link below).  For every fraction the transport to Germany is considered in the data set. The transportation includes all necessary transportation means like ship and where required railway.  The coke oven produces as main product coke out of hard coal. The main by-product resulting from this operation is coke oven gas (COG gas) which is used as energy carrier within the steel production. Further by-products as tar, benzene and sulphur are sold and therefore excluded from the system by allocation to (net) calorific value.  In the sinter plant sinter feed is produced based on the major inputs coke, iron ore and additives. Sintering is an agglomeration process which takes place under high temperatures. The raw materials (fine iron ore, coke breeze, additives) are blended, then the coke breeze is ignited. The result of the sinter process is the so-called sinter cake which has to be broken up, screened and cooled down.  The blast furnace is a closed system into which iron bearing materials (iron ore lump, sinter and / or pellets), additives (slag formers such as limestone) and reducing agents (coke) are continuously fed from the top of the furnace shaft through a charging system. A hot air blast, enriched with oxygen and auxiliary reducing agents (e.g. pulverized coal) is injected providing a counter-current of reducing gases. The air blast reacts with the reducing agents to produce mainly carbon monoxide which in turn reduces iron oxides to metal iron. The main products of the blast furnace operation are hot metal, blast furnace gas (BF gas) and blast furnace slag (BF slag). The BF gas is used as fuel for heating comparable to the COG gas or for electricity production.  The objective in oxygen steelmaking is to burn (i.e., oxidise) the undesirable impurities contained in the metallic feedstock. The main elements thus converted into oxides are carbon, silicon, manganese, phosphorus and sulphur. The purpose of this oxidation process, therefore, are to reduce the carbon content to a specified level to adjust the contents of desirable foreign elements and to remove undesirable impurities to the greatest possible extent. The production of steel by the basic oxygen furnace (BOF) process is a discontinuous process which involves the following steps: transfer and storage of hot metal, pre-treatment of hot metal (desulphurisation), oxidation in the BOF (decarburisation and oxidation of impurities) and secondary metallurgical treatment (e.g. vacuum treatment and adding alloying elements). Within the main step of the oxygen steelmaking, the hot metal feeds together with steel scrap the converter. The main products of the converter are the liquid steel, the converter gas or basic oxygen furnace gas (BOF gas) and the BOF slag. The gas is as well used as energy carrier within the steel production.  Afterwards the continuous casting takes place whereby the liquid steel is cast in continuous strand. The output of the continuous casting process is the slab.  The following operations are two rolling processes: the hot strip mill and the cold rolling mill. In the hot rolling mill the slab is reshaped above the recrystallization temperature. The qualities obtained in this process are e.g. strength and surface quality. During the rolling process the material passes through the furnace and the rolling line. In the furnace the metal is preheated by natural gas. There is no need for an additional warming, if the hot slabs are directly charged into the rolling mill. The forming is done in various rolling frames until the final shape is obtained. The steel scrap in this process are directly recycled.  In the cold rolling mill the material is reshaped below the recrystallization temperature. Thereby a enhanced surface quality, an improved dimensional accuracy as well as a higher strength are achieved. The different process steps are: pickling, the rolling line and the heat treatment.  The cold rolled sheet is transferred to the hot-dip galvanising. The zinc coating is applied by dipping the sheet steel into a hot zinc bath. During the hot-dip galvanising the cold rolled sheet passes the following process steps: preheating furnace (organic impurities are burned off), reduction zone (the sheet is heated to cause recrystallization), cooling and homogenization as well as metal bath (coating of the sheet)  and finishing stand.    Background system: Electricity: Electricity is modelled according to the individual country-specific situations.

Results are depicted in modules that allow the structured expression of results over the entire life cycle.,No,en,"The main processes in cement production consist of raw material extraction, production of clinker, and cement grinding. The extraction of the main raw material from the quarry normally takes place in the immediate area of the cement works.  Portland cement (CEM I) is primarily made up of finely ground clinker cement and a smaller amount of ground materials. Other cements may also include constituents such as slag sand (CEM III), natural puzzolan such as trass (CEM IV), fly ash, oil shale burn-out or limestone. The most important agent is the blast furnace cement (CEM III).  Coagulation is controlled with the help of minor constituents, such as calcium sulphate to facilitate its optimal processing in the concrete production.  Clinker cement is made up of a mixture of primary products of mainly calcium oxide, silica, aluminium oxide, and iron oxide. Limestone, chalk and clay (or their naturally occurring mixture of limestone marl) provide these chemical constituents.   The raw material mixture is heated to approximately 1450°C in a rotary furnace until sintering. New bonds are created from the source material, these are known as the clinker phases. These are specific calcium silicates and calcium aluminates that give the cement its characteristic property of hardening in the presence of water.         Secondary fuels for cement production are modelled with a ""cut-off approach"", i.e. the materials have no environmental burden.

Background system: Electricity: Electricity from renewable and non- renewable powerplants is modelled so that it represents a countrys specific consumption mix including transmission / distribution losses, own consumption, imports, emissions and efficiency standards, and energy carrier properties. Several factors are taken into account. (1) Energy carrier production - The exploration, mining / production, processing, and transportation of energy carrier supply chains are modelled for each country. The models account for differences among countries in production and processing, including crude oil production technologies, flaring rates, production efficiencies, emissions, etc. (2) Energy carrier supply - Each countrys specific energy carrier supply is modelled, taking into account domestic supply versus imports from abroad. Energy carrier properties (e.g. carbon and energy content), which can vary depending from where an energy carrier is sourced, are adjusted accordingly. (3) Power plants - Models are created to represent energy carrier-specific power plants and electricity generation facilities specific to different renewable energy resources. Energy carrier production and supply models are used to represent power plant inputs. Combined heat and power (CHP) plants are also considered. (4) Electricity grid - Models representing the electricity generation facilities are combined into a larger model that reflects a countrys consumption mix. The larger model accounts for a countrys production mix, internal consumption (e.g. pumped storage for hydro power), transmission / distribution losses, and imported electricity.

Thermal energy, process steam: The thermal energy and process steam supply is modelled to reflect each countrys emission standards and typical energy carriers (e.g., coal, natural gas, etc.) Both thermal energy and process steam are assumed to be produced at heat plants. Thermal energy datasets assume energy carrier inputs are converted to thermal energy with 100% efficiency; process steam datasets assume conversion efficiencies of 85%, 90% to 95%.

HIT-HY 200-A,Beschichtungen,Reaktionsharze,Reaktionsharze auf Methacrylatbasis,DE,"The declared product of HIT-HY 200-A is a two-component system.  The resin component (component A) comprises a resin based on methacrylates as well as mineral and cement-like fillers. The curing agent component(component B) comprises of peroxide hardener, water and mineral fillers.  Mixing the two components A and B in the static mixer initiates the curing (hardening) reaction of both binder systems. During the curing phase, a very strong bond is formed between the organic and inorganic binder matrix.  The hybrid system formed during cement and resin curing results in a cross-linked duromer with desired design properties (high bond strengths within short curing time) and particular long-term stability.   Composite foils are used for the two-component foil pack of HIT-HY 200-A. This kind of packaging serves the following purposes: waste volume reduction, easy storage and transport, less packaging material.   Through legislation and increased public awareness users have increasingly become discerned towards the use of styrene and other highly volatile components with their resulting unpleasant odor and low flash point (flammability).  The reaction resins used in all Hilti hybrid adhesives contain no styrene, are practically odorless and have a considerably higher flash point, i.e. higher than 100 °C in comparison to 34 °C for styrene-based products.

The transport is exclusively by truck. Chemical mortars are usually two-component systems consisting of a binder and a hardener. One of the base components of the binder is the reactive resin which in the case of HIT-HY 200-A is produced in Kaufering. The resin production process is a chemical reaction of the corresponding educts to a basic resin with subsequent mixing of the basic resin with different reactive diluents to a reactive resin. This process is controlled and monitored by process control technology. The production of chemical mortars consists of a mixing process and a filling process of the respective single components (binder and hardener) and their subsequent union to a two-component system (container). Here as well process control technology is used to weigh and mix solid and liquid compounds according to specification. In the next step both well-mixed components run through an automized filling line in which each of the processed masses is filled into a tubular foil bag. Finally the single components are united in one container. The two-pack foil bags are packed into cardboard boxes and then finally shipped.

Plastics that are not recycled are introduced to the municipal waste incineration. For the MWI a European model with average emission values and energy production rates was used. Depending on the incinerated type of plastic, different processes with corresponding elemental compositions were used. Then dataset were set up in collaboration with the Confederation of European Waste-to-Energy Plants (CEWEP) and are available on the website of the European Platform on LCA [EC 2008].

The data sets represent exterior paints as well as first coatings.   There are datasets for latex paints and precoats with a silicate and polymer base.   Silicate paints have a soluble potassium as a bonding agent. The curing is achieved through silification (crystalline petrification) with the subgrade.

Background system: Electricity: Electricity from renewable and non- renewable powerplants is modelled so that it represents a countrys specific consumption mix including transmission / distribution losses, own consumption, imports, emissions and efficiency standards, and energy carrier properties. Several factors are taken into account. (1) Energy carrier production - The exploration, mining / production, processing, and transportation of energy carrier supply chains are modelled for each country. The models account for differences among countries in production and processing, including crude oil production technologies, flaring rates, production efficiencies, emissions, etc. (2) Energy carrier supply - Each countrys specific energy carrier supply is modelled, taking into account domestic supply versus imports from abroad. Energy carrier properties (e.g. carbon and energy content), which can vary depending from where an energy carrier is sourced, are adjusted accordingly. (3) Power plants - Models are created to represent energy carrier-specific power plants and electricity generation facilities specific to different renewable energy resources. Energy carrier production and supply models are used to represent power plant inputs. Combined heat and power (CHP) plants are also considered. (4) Electricity grid - Models representing the electricity generation facilities are combined into a larger model that reflects a countrys consumption mix. The larger model accounts for a countrys production mix, internal consumption (e.g. pumped storage for hydro power), transmission / distribution losses, and imported electricity. The country model is also adjusted according to national power plant emission and efficiency standards, as well as the countrys share of electricity plants versus CHP facilities.

The extraction of the main raw material from the quarry normally takes place in the immediate area of the cement works.  Portland cement (CEM I) is primarily made up of finely ground clinker cement and a smaller amount of ground materials. Other cements may also include constituents such as slag sand (CEM III), natural puzzolan such as trass (CEM IV), fly ash, oil shale burn-out or limestone. The most important agent is the blast furnace cement (CEM III).  Coagulation is controlled with the help of minor constituents, such as calcium sulphate to facilitate its optimal processing in the concrete production.  Clinker cement is made up of a mixture of primary products of mainly calcium oxide, silica, aluminium oxide, and iron oxide. Limestone, chalk and clay (or their naturally occurring mixture of limestone marl) provide these chemical constituents.   The raw material mixture is heated to approximately 1450°C in a rotary furnace until sintering. New bonds are created from the source material, these are known as the clinker phases. These are specific calcium silicates and calcium aluminates that give the cement its characteristic property of hardening in the presence of water.        Secondary fuels for cement production are modelled with a ""cut-off approach"", i.e. the materials have no environmental burden.

Granulated Blast Furnace Slag (GBFS) is a by-product from the steel industry. In a blast furnace, iron contained raw materials is separated from the other minerals. These minerals are evacuated in the molten phase-out of the furnace, through a runner, into a granulator. The granulator is quenching the molten stream using water. In the typical blast furnace process, hard coal (or coke), iron ore and limestone are introduced into the top of the furnace. From the bottom, hot air is blown into the furnace. Due to the combustion of carbon in the hottest zone (at the bottom) carbon dioxide is formed. The carbon dioxide moves upwards, and when in contact with carbon at lower temperatures, carbon monoxide is formed (boudouard reaction). The carbon monoxide reacts with iron ore (iron oxide) and forms pig iron. The solid content (coal and iron) moves to the bottom of the furnace to the hottest zone (melting zone) where the iron is melted and removed from the furnace in liquid state. Slag is formed at the bottom of the furnace (it`s a mixture of different oxides). Waste gases (containing excess carbon monoxide) leave the furnace at the top and are incinerated which produces electricity (energy credit is modelled).

The thermal energy for maintaining the temperature during delivery to the construction site was neglected.   Background system: Electricity: Electricity from renewable and non- renewable powerplants is modelled so that it represents a countrys specific consumption mix including transmission / distribution losses, own consumption, imports, emissions and efficiency standards, and energy carrier properties. Several factors are taken into account. (1) Energy carrier production - The exploration, mining / production, processing, and transportation of energy carrier supply chains are modelled for each country. The models account for differences among countries in production and processing, including crude oil production technologies, flaring rates, production efficiencies, emissions, etc. (2) Energy carrier supply - Each countrys specific energy carrier supply is modelled, taking into account domestic supply versus imports from abroad. Energy carrier properties (e.g. carbon and energy content), which can vary depending from where an energy carrier is sourced, are adjusted accordingly. (3) Power plants - Models are created to represent energy carrier-specific power plants and electricity generation facilities specific to different renewable energy resources. Energy carrier production and supply models are used to represent power plant inputs. Combined heat and power (CHP) plants are also considered. (4) Electricity grid - Models representing the electricity generation facilities are combined into a larger model that reflects a countrys consumption mix. The larger model accounts for a countrys production mix, internal consumption (e.g. pumped storage for hydro power), transmission / distribution losses, and imported electricity. The country model is also adjusted according to national power plant emission and efficiency standards, as well as the countrys share of electricity plants versus CHP facilities. Thermal energy, process steam: The thermal energy and process steam supply is modelled to reflect each countrys emission standards and typical energy carriers (e.g., coal, natural gas, etc.) Both thermal energy and process steam are assumed to be produced at heat plants. Thermal energy datasets assume energy carrier inputs are converted to thermal energy with 100% efficiency; process steam datasets assume conversion efficiencies of 85%, 90% to 95%.

The purification of groundwater is less complicated than that one of surface water, some of the steps are similar.  Water extracted from lakes or rivers still contains a lot of microbes and hazardous chemicals which have to be removed to make it drinkable.    The Following steps are common to achieve the high quality of drinking water:   Clarification: Silt, algae, colour, manganese and other matter from raw water.  A coagulant like aluminium or iron salt is used to coagulate the undesired matter from the water which can then easily be removed by sedimentation or flotation.  Filtration: Particles are removed by using filters during this stage. There is a variety of different filter types, two examples are a bed of sand and a membrane filter.   Disinfection: All hazardous microbes have to be removed. The most common method for disinfection is using chlorine.

Background system: Electricity: Electricity from renewable and non- renewable powerplants is modelled so that it represents a countrys specific consumption mix including transmission / distribution losses, own consumption, imports, emissions and efficiency standards, and energy carrier properties. Several factors are taken into account. (1) Energy carrier production - The exploration, mining / production, processing, and transportation of energy carrier supply chains are modelled for each country. The models account for differences among countries in production and processing, including crude oil production technologies, flaring rates, production efficiencies, emissions, etc. (2) Energy carrier supply - Each countrys specific energy carrier supply is modelled, taking into account domestic supply versus imports from abroad. Energy carrier properties (e.g. carbon and energy content), which can vary depending from where an energy carrier is sourced, are adjusted accordingly. (3) Power plants - Models are created to represent energy carrier-specific power plants and electricity generation facilities specific to different renewable energy resources. Energy carrier production and supply models are used to represent power plant inputs. Combined heat and power (CHP) plants are also considered. (4) Electricity grid - Models representing the electricity generation facilities are combined into a larger model that reflects a countrys consumption mix. The larger model accounts for a countrys production mix, internal consumption (e.g. pumped storage for hydro power), transmission / distribution losses, and imported electricity. The country model is also adjusted according to national power plant emission and efficiency standards, as well as the countrys share of electricity plants versus CHP facilities. Thermal energy, process steam: The thermal energy and process steam supply is modelled to reflect each countrys emission standards and typical energy carriers (e.g., coal, natural gas, etc.) Both thermal energy and process steam are assumed to be produced at heat plants. Thermal energy datasets assume energy carrier inputs are converted to thermal energy with 100% efficiency; process steam datasets assume conversion efficiencies of 85%, 90% to 95%.

In the process known as De Lavaud, the pipes are produced in chill-moulds which are cooled with water from the outside. The space between the sand core and the chill-mould is filled with 1400°C hot iron and the machine begins to move. The interaction of longitudinal and radial motion and the centrifugal force on the fluid iron allows the pipe to form on the wall of the chill-mould.  The iron cools down, solidifies and shrinks. The pipes are subsequently thermally treated. They are layered with epoxy resin on the inside and acrylic paint on the outside.  The most important inputs during production of the SML pipes are therefore gray iron (manufactured from secondary metals), thermal energy and power.     It is expected, that the recycling quote of big appliances like boilers, air conditioning, and ventilation systems is 95%. For pipes or cables which are often flush-mounted a 90% recycling quote is expected. The quotes are only related to metals and plastics. For mineral materials like mineral wool, concrete or ceramics inert landfilling is assumed, as well as for 5-10% of metals and plastics (e.g. cable waste and pipe pieces) that are not recycled. Plastics that are not recycled are introduced to the municipal waste incineration. For the MWI a European model with average emission values and energy production rates was used. Depending on the incinerated type of plastic, different processes with corresponding elemental compositions were used. Then dataset were set up in collaboration with the Confederation of European Waste-to-Energy Plants (CEWEP) and are available on the website of the European Platform on LCA [EC 2008]. Power and thermal energy produced in the MWI are accounted to the European power- and thermal energy mix. The credits for the metal recycling and the energetic recovery of plastics, as well as the emission and resource consumptions (energy for remelting, incineration emissions, landfilling) are included in the datasets. Iron materials (steel sheet, pipes, grey cast iron) already use a share of steel scrap at the production. These values are deducted from the recycled steel material before introduced to the melting to avoid a overvaluation of the credits. For the credits primary steel was used. Credits for the recycling of rare earth or mercury emissions from fluorescent lamps are not considered due to a lack of information. The assumed transport distance from building to recycling plant/landfilling site or MWI are 50km using a truck. The assumed distance to the steel, copper, and aluminium plant is 200km by train.

Results are depicted in modules that allow the structured expression of results over the entire life cycle.,No,en,"The main processes in cement production consist of raw material extraction, production of clinker, and cement grinding. The extraction of the main raw material from the quarry normally takes place in the immediate area of the cement works.  Portland cement (CEM I) is primarily made up of finely ground clinker cement and a smaller amount of ground materials. Other cements may also include constituents such as slag sand (CEM III), natural puzzolan such as trass (CEM IV), fly ash, oil shale burn-out or limestone. The most important agent is the blast furnace cement (CEM III).  Coagulation is controlled with the help of minor constituents, such as calcium sulphate to facilitate its optimal processing in the concrete production.  Clinker cement is made up of a mixture of primary products of mainly calcium oxide, silica, aluminium oxide, and iron oxide. Limestone, chalk and clay (or their naturally occurring mixture of limestone marl) provide these chemical constituents.   The raw material mixture is heated to approximately 1450°C in a rotary furnace until sintering. New bonds are created from the source material, these are known as the clinker phases. These are specific calcium silicates and calcium aluminates that give the cement its characteristic property of hardening in the presence of water.  Secondary fuels for cement production are modelled with a ""cut-off approach"", i.e. the materials have no environmental burden.

Background system: Electricity: Electricity from renewable and non- renewable powerplants is modelled so that it represents a countrys specific consumption mix including transmission / distribution losses, own consumption, imports, emissions and efficiency standards, and energy carrier properties. Several factors are taken into account. (1) Energy carrier production - The exploration, mining / production, processing, and transportation of energy carrier supply chains are modelled for each country. The models account for differences among countries in production and processing, including crude oil production technologies, flaring rates, production efficiencies, emissions, etc. (2) Energy carrier supply - Each countrys specific energy carrier supply is modelled, taking into account domestic supply versus imports from abroad. Energy carrier properties (e.g. carbon and energy content), which can vary depending from where an energy carrier is sourced, are adjusted accordingly. (3) Power plants - Models are created to represent energy carrier-specific power plants and electricity generation facilities specific to different renewable energy resources. Energy carrier production and supply models are used to represent power plant inputs. Combined heat and power (CHP) plants are also considered. (4) Electricity grid - Models representing the electricity generation facilities are combined into a larger model that reflects a countrys consumption mix. The larger model accounts for a countrys production mix, internal consumption (e.g. pumped storage for hydro power), transmission / distribution losses, and imported electricity. The country model is also adjusted according to national power plant emission and efficiency standards, as well as the countrys share of electricity plants versus CHP facilities. Thermal energy, process steam: The thermal energy and process steam supply is modelled to reflect each countrys emission standards and typical energy carriers (e.g., coal, natural gas, etc.) Both thermal energy and process steam are assumed to be produced at heat plants.

Reinforcing steel in bars,Metalle,Stahl und Eisen,Betonstabstahl,BR,"Rebar is short for reinforcing (steel) bar, used for the reinforcement of concrete according to EN10080 standard (as weldable reinforcing steel in bars and coils).",No,en,"Rebar (Reinforcing Steel in bars, including standard rebars, special rebars – Krybar®, rock bolt and tie bars - and threaded bars) covers carbon steel for geotechnical use and the reinforcement of concrete. The surface of rebars is patterned to form a better bond with soil and concrete; in addition the ribs on threaded bars, rock bolts and tie bars allow for bolting. The rebar is produced by the primary and secondary route. “Primary” steel production refers to that which uses iron ore as its main source of metallic input, whereas “secondary” production is that based on scrap. However, in many instances this distinction can become less clear-cut, as scrap is often used in primary production, and iron is commonly used in electric furnaces, which are the typical unit for secondary production. The primary production pathway is more complex than the secondary route, comprising multiple different process arrangements. The most common primary production pathway is the blast furnace-basic oxygen furnace (BF-BOF) route. Coke and iron ore (normally sinter produced from iron ore and limestone) are both fed into the blast furnace from the top; simultaneously, hot air and pulverised coal or natural gas (hydrogen is experimentally being used) are injected through pipes in the side of the lower part of the furnace called tuyeres. This results in a counter-cyclical process of descending iron ore met by rising reducing gases. Lime fluxes and other additives are also used in the blast furnace in varying quantities to control the level of impurities and the temperature. The blast furnace produces molten iron (“hot metal”) at temperatures up to 1 400-1 500°C. The hot metal is then fed to the BOF, often in conjunction with some scrap, where oxygen is injected to lower the carbon content from approximately 4-5% to the required level of carbon for the steel grade produced. The other main method of primary steel production is the direct reduced iron-electric arc furnace (DRI-EAF) route, which is the one used in Hamburg. The principal differences between this route and the BF-BOF route are: •The type of iron ore that is typically used – high-quality DRI pellets are used in the DRI-EAF route, whereas the BF-BOF route has the flexibility to use iron ore with more impurities, and a combination of pellets, fines, sinter and lump ore. •The state of the material when it is reduced – the iron ore is reduced in a solid state in the DRI furnace (as opposed to the liquid phase in the blast furnace), before being melted in the EAF, often in conjunction with some scrap. •The main reduction agents – they are carbon and carbon monoxide in the BF-BOF route, while hydrogen and carbon monoxide play more balanced roles in the DRI-EAF pathway. •The balance of energy inputs – DRI-EAF facilities today mainly use natural gas to generate the reducing syngas (carbon monoxide and hydrogen), but can also use coal, while BF-BOF producers mainly use coke and coal, with natural gas injection being less common. In the secondary route, which is the one in Warsaw, different steel scraps are melted in an electric arc furnace to obtain liquid steel. In both routes, the produced liquid steel is then refined in a ladle furnace with addition of ferroalloys and metals to obtain the required steel characteristics. The steel is then casted at a continuous caster to obtain semi-finished products as billet or blooms. These products are then rolled to the desired size. The rib profile is rolled onto the bar in the last stand of the rolling process. There are two methods to achieve the required mechanical properties in hot rolled bars, either through in-line heat treatment QST (Quenching and Self-Tempering) or by micro-alloying additions. At the end of the rolling operation, the rebar is cut to the required length, generally bundled and labeled.  Technical data:  Technical specifications are listed below.

Following the degradation, a processing machine subdivides the raw pumice into different mineral size classes. Firstly, the machine disposes of all metallic matter using a magnet. Then a primary sieve separates the raw pumice into two groups and each group has its own processing sequence.  The grains larger than 2 mm are fed into a sieve jigger in which the raw pumice is separated into two quality grades on an impulse-driven water bed. The lighter, floating high-grade pumice is separated in a complex, 3-step process in which the light as well as the heavier parts with poor insulating properties are removed. In a separate processing of the fine material (= 2 mm), the pumice with a high purity level in this fraction can be separated from the heavier sand. The water required for this process is sent to its own reservoir where it is clarified and recirculated. Foreign bodies from the separation processes such as grit and sand can be used in road-building or can be used as abrasives.      Background system: Electricity: Electricity is modelled according to the individual country-specific situations.

For mineral materials like mineral wool, concrete or ceramics inert landfilling is assumed, as well as for 5-10% of metals and plastics (e.g. cable waste and pipe pieces) that are not recycled. Plastics that are not recycled are introduced to the municipal waste incineration.  For the MWI a German model with average emission values and energy production rates was used. Depending on the incinerated type of plastic, different processes with corresponding elemental compositions were used.

Production of PPS granulate: Polyphenylene sulphide PPS is produced by the polycondensation of 1.4 butanediol with sodium sulfide. First of all an aqueous solution of Sodium hydrosulfide and sodium hydroxide reacts under nitrogen to a solution of sodium sulfied. This solution of sodium sulfide is mixed with the solvent n-methylpyrrolidone.  Then water is distilled to become same parts of water and solvent. In the presence of nitrogen p-dichlorobenzene is added to the polymerisation under heating and pressure. After that water, unreacted dcb and about a  third of the solvent are vented. The rest of the material will be heated. It is given to a flash vessel. A certain part of NMP flashes there and liquid or solid material drops down into a heated screw conveyor.

The model represents the country specific material and energy consumption according to ArcelorMittal production shares, using horizontal weighted averages. The cold rolled coil is manufactured through the blast furnace-basic oxygen furnace (BF-BOF) route. Coke and iron ore (normally sinter produced from iron ore and limestone) are both fed into the blast furnace from the top; simultaneously, hot air and pulverised coal or natural gas (hydrogen is experimentally being used) are injected through pipes in the side of the lower part of the furnace called tuyeres. This results in a counter-cyclical process of descending iron ore met by rising reducing gases. Lime fluxes and other additives are also used in the blast furnace in varying quantities to control the level of impurities and the temperature. The blast furnace produces molten iron (“hot metal”) at temperatures up to 1400-1 500°C. The hot metal is then fed to the BOF, often in conjunction with some scrap, where oxygen is injected to lower the carbon content from approximately 4-5% to the required level of carbon for the steel grade produced. The produced liquid steel is then refined in a ladle furnace with addition of ferroalloys and metals to obtain the required steel characteristics. The steel is then casted at a continuous caster to obtain semi-finished products such as billets, blooms or slabs. The following operations are two rolling processes: the hot strip mill and the cold rolling mill. In the hot rolling mill the slab is reshaped above the recrystallization temperature. The qualities obtained in this process are e.g. strength and surface quality. During the rolling process the material passes through the furnace and the rolling line. In the furnace the metal is preheated by natural gas. There is no need for an additional warming, if the hot slabs are directly charged into the rolling mill. The forming is done in various rolling frames until the final shape is obtained. The steel scrap in this process are directly recycled. In the cold rolling mill the material is reshaped below the recrystallization temperature. Thereby a enhanced surface quality, an improved dimensional accuracy as well as a higher strength are achieved. The different process steps are: pickling, the rolling line and the heat treatment.

Other cements may also include constituents such as slag sand (CEM III), natural puzzolan such as trass (CEM IV), fly ash, oil shale burn-out or limestone. The most important agent is the blast furnace cement (CEM III).  Coagulation is controlled with the help of minor constituents, such as calcium sulphate to facilitate its optimal processing in the concrete production.  Clinker cement is made up of a mixture of primary products of mainly calcium oxide, silica, aluminium oxide, and iron oxide.

Modelling the electricity consumption mix includes transmission / distribution losses and the own use by energy producers (own consumption of power plants and ""other"" own consumption e.g. due to pumped storage hydro power etc.), as well as imported electricity. Secondly, the national emission and efficiency standards of the power plants are modelled as well as the share of electricity plants and combined heat and power plants (CHP). Thirdly, the country-specific energy carrier supply (share of imports and / or domestic supply) including the country-specific energy carrier properties (e.g. element and energy content) are accounted for. Fourthly, the exploration, mining/production, processing and transport processes of the energy carrier supply chains are modelled according to the specific situation of each electricity producing country. The different production and processing techniques (emissions and efficiencies) in the different energy producing countries are considered, e.g. different crude oil production technologies or different flaring rates at the oil platforms. Thermal energy, process steam: The thermal energy and process steam supply is modelled according to the individual country-specific situation with regard to emission standards and considered energy carriers. The thermal energy and process steam are produced at heat plants. Efficiencies for thermal energy production are by definition 100% in relation to the corresponding energy carrier input. For process steam the efficiency ranges from 85%, 90% to 95%.

The use of epoxy resin has a significant impact on the LCA results.   Background system: Electricity: Electricity from renewable and non- renewable powerplants is modelled so that it represents a countrys specific consumption mix including transmission / distribution losses, own consumption, imports, emissions and efficiency standards, and energy carrier properties. Several factors are taken into account. (1) Energy carrier production - The exploration, mining / production, processing, and transportation of energy carrier supply chains are modelled for each country. The models account for differences among countries in production and processing, including crude oil production technologies, flaring rates, production efficiencies, emissions, etc. (2) Energy carrier supply - Each countrys specific energy carrier supply is modelled, taking into account domestic supply versus imports from abroad. Energy carrier properties (e.g. carbon and energy content), which can vary depending from where an energy carrier is sourced, are adjusted accordingly. (3) Power plants - Models are created to represent energy carrier-specific power plants and electricity generation facilities specific to different renewable energy resources. Energy carrier production and supply models are used to represent power plant inputs. Combined heat and power (CHP) plants are also considered. (4) Electricity grid - Models representing the electricity generation facilities are combined into a larger model that reflects a countrys consumption mix. The larger model accounts for a countrys production mix, internal consumption (e.g. pumped storage for hydro power), transmission / distribution losses, and imported electricity. The country model is also adjusted according to national power plant emission and efficiency standards, as well as the countrys share of electricity plants versus CHP facilities. Thermal energy, process steam: The thermal energy and process steam supply is modelled to reflect each countrys emission standards and typical energy carriers (e.g., coal, natural gas, etc.) Both thermal energy and process steam are assumed to be produced at heat plants. Thermal energy datasets assume energy carrier inputs are converted to thermal energy with 100% efficiency; process steam datasets assume conversion efficiencies of 85%, 90% to 95%. The energy carriers used for the generation of thermal energy and process steam are modelled according to each countrys import situation (see electricity above). Transportation: All relevant and known transportation processes are included. Ocean-going and inland ship transport as well as rail, truck and pipeline transport of bulk commodities are considered. Energy carriers: The energy carriers and their respective properties are modelled according to the specific supply situation (see electricity above). Refinery products: Diesel fuel, gasoline, technical gases, fuel oils, lubricants and residues such as bitumen are modelled with a parameterised country-specific refinery model.

Steel sheet (20µm hot dip galvanized),Metalle,Stahl und Eisen,Stahlbleche,DE,This data set has been modeled according to the European Standard EN 15804 for Sustainable Building. Results are depicted in modules that allow the structured expression of results over the entire life cycle.,No,en,"The data set represents the steel production in Germany based on the main production steps which take place within an integrated steel plant. These production steps as well as the main upstream process steps are described in the following.  The main primary products are iron ore, pellets and hard coal. The import mix for the German steel production concerning iron ore and pellets is: Canada 50%, Brazil 25%, Australia 25%. The import mix for the German steel production concerning hard coal is: 100% Canada. The iron ore mining is explained in detail in the respective documentation file (please see link below). The preparation of the iron ore includes mainly the crushing. The average iron content in the iron ore is 60%. Pellets are small crystallized balls of iron ore. The pelletisation process consists of grinding and drying, balling and induration followed by screening and handling. The provision of hard coal is described in the respective documentation file (please see link below).  For every fraction the transport to Germany is considered in the data set. The transportation includes all necessary transportation means like ship and where required railway.  The coke oven produces as main product coke out of hard coal. The main by-product resulting from this operation is coke oven gas (COG gas) which is used as energy carrier within the steel production. Further by-products as tar, benzene and sulphur are sold and therefore excluded from the system by allocation to (net) calorific value.  In the sinter plant sinter feed is produced based on the major inputs coke, iron ore and additives. Sintering is an agglomeration process which takes place under high temperatures. The raw materials (fine iron ore, coke breeze, additives) are blended, then the coke breeze is ignited. The result of the sinter process is the so-called sinter cake which has to be broken up, screened and cooled down.  The blast furnace is a closed system into which iron bearing materials (iron ore lump, sinter and / or pellets), additives (slag formers such as limestone) and reducing agents (coke) are continuously fed from the top of the furnace shaft through a charging system. A hot air blast, enriched with oxygen and auxiliary reducing agents (e.g. pulverized coal) is injected providing a counter-current of reducing gases. The air blast reacts with the reducing agents to produce mainly carbon monoxide which in turn reduces iron oxides to metal iron. The main products of the blast furnace operation are hot metal, blast furnace gas (BF gas) and blast furnace slag (BF slag). The BF gas is used as fuel for heating comparable to the COG gas or for electricity production.  The objective in oxygen steelmaking is to burn (i.e., oxidise) the undesirable impurities contained in the metallic feedstock. The main elements thus converted into oxides are carbon, silicon, manganese, phosphorus and sulphur. The purpose of this oxidation process, therefore, are to reduce the carbon content to a specified level to adjust the contents of desirable foreign elements and to remove undesirable impurities to the greatest possible extent. The production of steel by the basic oxygen furnace (BOF) process is a discontinuous process which involves the following steps: transfer and storage of hot metal, pre-treatment of hot metal (desulphurisation), oxidation in the BOF (decarburisation and oxidation of impurities) and secondary metallurgical treatment (e.g. vacuum treatment and adding alloying elements). Within the main step of the oxygen steelmaking, the hot metal feeds together with steel scrap the converter. The main products of the converter are the liquid steel, the converter gas or basic oxygen furnace gas (BOF gas) and the BOF slag. The gas is as well used as energy carrier within the steel production.  Afterwards the continuous casting takes place whereby the liquid steel is cast in continuous strand. The output of the continuous casting process is the slab.  The following operations are two rolling processes: the hot strip mill and the cold rolling mill. In the hot rolling mill the slab is reshaped above the recrystallization temperature. The qualities obtained in this process are e.g. strength and surface quality. During the rolling process the material passes through the furnace and the rolling line. In the furnace the metal is preheated by natural gas. There is no need for an additional warming, if the hot slabs are directly charged into the rolling mill. The forming is done in various rolling frames until the final shape is obtained. The steel scrap in this process are directly recycled.  In the cold rolling mill the material is reshaped below the recrystallization temperature. Thereby a enhanced surface quality, an improved dimensional accuracy as well as a higher strength are achieved. The different process steps are: pickling, the rolling line and the heat treatment.  In the hot-dip aluminising process the cold rolled sheet is dipped into a molten aluminium bath. Thus the sheet is coated with aluminium.    Background system: Electricity: Electricity is modelled according to the individual country-specific situations.

Results are depicted in modules that allow the structured expression of results over the entire life cycle.,No,en,"The main processes in cement production consist of raw material extraction, production of clinker, and cement grinding. The extraction of the main raw material from the quarry normally takes place in the immediate area of the cement works.  Portland cement (CEM I) is primarily made up of finely ground clinker cement and a smaller amount of ground materials. Other cements may also include constituents such as slag sand (CEM III), natural puzzolan such as trass (CEM IV), fly ash, oil shale burn-out or limestone. The most important agent is the blast furnace cement (CEM III).  Coagulation is controlled with the help of minor constituents, such as calcium sulphate to facilitate its optimal processing in the concrete production.  Clinker cement is made up of a mixture of primary products of mainly calcium oxide, silica, aluminium oxide, and iron oxide. Limestone, chalk and clay (or their naturally occurring mixture of limestone marl) provide these chemical constituents.   The raw material mixture is heated to approximately 1450°C in a rotary furnace until sintering. New bonds are created from the source material, these are known as the clinker phases. These are specific calcium silicates and calcium aluminates that give the cement its characteristic property of hardening in the presence of water.  Secondary fuels for cement production are modelled with a ""cut-off approach"", i.e. the materials have no environmental burden.       Background system: Electricity: Electricity is modelled according to the individual country-specific situations.

The model represents the country specific material and energy consumption according to ArcelorMittal production shares, using horizontal weighted averages. The hot rolled coil is manufactured through the blast furnace-basic oxygen furnace (BF-BOF) route. Coke and iron ore (normally sinter produced from iron ore and limestone) are both fed into the blast furnace from the top; simultaneously, hot air and pulverised coal or natural gas (hydrogen is experimentally being used) are injected through pipes in the side of the lower part of the furnace called tuyeres. This results in a counter-cyclical process of descending iron ore met by rising reducing gases. Lime fluxes and other additives are also used in the blast furnace in varying quantities to control the level of impurities and the temperature. The blast furnace produces molten iron (“hot metal”) at temperatures up to 1400-1 500°C. The hot metal is then fed to the BOF, often in conjunction with some scrap, where oxygen is injected to lower the carbon content from approximately 4-5% to the required level of carbon for the steel grade produced. The produced liquid steel is then refined in a ladle furnace with addition of ferroalloys and metals to obtain the required steel characteristics. The steel is then casted at a continuous caster to obtain semi-finished products such as billets, blooms or slabs. These products are then rolled to the desired sizes and shapes. In the hot rolling mill the slab is reshaped above the recrystallization temperature. The qualities obtained in this process are e.g. strength and surface quality. During the rolling process the material passes through the furnace and the rolling line. In the furnace the metal is preheated by natural gas. There is no need for an additional warming, if the hot slabs are directly charged into the rolling mill. The forming is done in various rolling frames until the final shape is obtained. The steel scrap in this process are directly recycled.  Technical data:  ArcelorMittal Europe Flat products is producing Hot Rolled Steel Coils in 8 mills.

It can be processed by all conventional processing operations used for hot rolled: cutting and oxy-cutting, slitting, bending, drawing, clinching, profiling, stamping, welding etc.    Indaten® weathering steels offer improved resistance to corrosion thanks to the addition of copper during manufacture.   Additional alloying elements can be added to increase the steel’s tensile strength or make forming processes easier.  When weathering steel is exposed to the ambient atmosphere it develops an initial layer of iron oxide in the same way as carbon steel. The rate of oxidation depends on how much oxygen, moisture, and atmospheric contaminants can access the surface of the metal. In the initial stages, a complex mix of iron oxides covers the surface to create a layer of rust. As the process progresses, the rust layer forms a barrier against the corrosive agents and the rate of corrosion slows down.   Amstrong® high-strength steels are available as thermo-mechanically hot rolled, cold formable grades. Their main properties include high yield strength and tensile strength, combined with appropriate formability, toughness at low temperatures and fatigue resistance.

The reaction enthalpy is + 3010 kJ/kg. In the kiln, the gas temperature is usually 1200- 1300°C, at least 900°C is needed for the reaction. The energy consumed by the endothermic reaction is delivered by burning coke. The kilns used are usually vertical- shaft furnaces. At the top, a mixture of limestone and coke enters the furnace. The first step is the preheating zone which is about 800°C hot. As the limestone- fuel- mixtures moves down, it reaches the calcining zone. There, temperatures are 1200- 1300°C caused by the combustion of the fuel. Air is introduced to make the combustion possible. In the calcining zone, the decomposition of limestone takes place. The hot gases (containing CO2) are moving upwards heating the preheating zone. The lime produced by calcining moves down to the last zone, the cooling zone where it cools down. An alternative to the vertical- shaft kiln is a rotary kiln. The preheating and reaction procedure is the same, but the furnace is a horizontal (slightly inclined) rotating drum, the limestone- fuel- mixture moves down the inclined plane.

Stainless steel drinking water pipe,Metalle,Edelstahl,Edelstahl Trinkwasserrohre,DE,This data set has been modeled according to the European Standard EN 15804 for Sustainable Building. Results are depicted in modules that allow the structured expression of results over the entire life cycle.,No,en,"The dataset describes the production of a stainless steel drinking water pipe made of stainless steel (cold rolled). In so doing, the process of bending the steel sheet, the production of the welding seam as well as all necessary materials and energy expenditures have been considered. Transports from the factory to the building site are not considered and must be included according to the system boundaries. The main process step is the melting of stainless steel scrap in the electric arc furnace (EAF), thus the consumed energy is mainly electric power. The major feed stock for the EAF is stainless steel scrap, which may comprise of scrap from inside the steelworks (e.g. cut-offs), cut-offs from steel product manufacturers (e.g. vehicle builders) and post-consumer scrap (e.g. end of life products). As in the integrated steel plant including blast furnaces and converters, a slag is formed from lime to collect undesirable components in the steel. Thus lime is an additive as well as coal (carbon) as reducing agent and alloying elements. Oxygen lances and / or oxy-fuel burners are used to assist in the early stages of melting.  For every material fraction the transport is considered in the data set.   For the production of carbon steel and low alloyed steels, following main operations are performed: raw material handling and storage, furnace charging with/without scrap preheating, EAF scrap melting, steel and slag tapping, ladle furnace treatments for quality adjustment, slag handling and finally continuous casting.   For high alloyed respectively stainless steels, the operation sequence is more complex and tailor-made for the end-products. In addition to the mentioned operations for carbon steels various ladle treatments (secondary metallurgy) are carried out like desulphurisation, degassing for the elimination of dissolved gases like nitrogen and hydrogen, decarburisation (AOD=Argon-Oxygen-Decarburisation or VOD=Vacuum-Oxygen-Decarburisation).  The following operations are two rolling processes: the hot strip mill and the cold rolling mill. In the hot rolling mill the slab is reshaped above the recrystallization temperature. The qualities obtained in this process are e.g. strength and surface quality. During the rolling process the material passes through the furnace and the rolling line. In the furnace the metal is preheated by natural gas. There is no need for an additional warming, if the hot slabs are directly charged into the rolling mill. The forming is done in various rolling frames until the final shape is obtained. The steel scrap in this process are directly recycled.  In the cold rolling mill the material is reshaped below the recrystallization temperature. Thereby a enhanced surface quality, an improved dimensional accuracy as well as a higher strength are achieved. The different process steps are: pickling, the rolling line and the heat treatment.

A rail is a hot rolled steel product used for forming a track for wheeled vehicles or cranes. The product is manufactured through the blast furnace-basic oxygen furnace (BF-BOF) route. Coke and iron ore (normally sinter produced from iron ore and limestone) are both fed into the blast furnace from the top; simultaneously, hot air and pulverised coal or natural gas (hydrogen is experimentally being used) are injected through pipes in the side of the lower part of the furnace called tuyeres. This results in a counter-cyclical process of descending iron ore met by rising reducing gases. Lime fluxes and other additives are also used in the blast furnace in varying quantities to control the level of impurities and the temperature. The blast furnace produces molten iron (“hot metal”) at temperatures up to 1400-1 500°C. The hot metal is then fed to the BOF, often in conjunction with some scrap, where oxygen is injected to lower the carbon content from approximately 4-5% to the required level of carbon for the steel grade produced. The produced liquid steel is then refined in a ladle furnace with addition of ferroalloys and metals to obtain the required steel characteristics. The steel is then casted at a continuous caster to obtain semi-finished products such as billets, blooms or slabs.

The surface of rebars is patterned to form a better bond with soil and concrete, in addition the ribs on threaded bars, rock bolts and tie bars allow for bolting. The Life Cycle Assessment is based on annual data collected from the plants involved in the production: Warsaw in Poland and Hamburg in Germany. Rebar from these plants is obtained from scrap and direct reduced iron (DRI) melted in Electric Arc Furnace. This steel is then refined in a ladle furnace with addition of ferroalloys and metals to obtain the required steel characteristics. The steel is then casted at a continuous caster to obtain semi-finished products as billets or blooms. The semis are then rolled to the desired size. The rib profile is rolled onto the bar in the last stand of the rolling process. There are two methods to achieve the required mechanical properties in hot rolled bars, either through in-line heat treatment QST (Quenching and Self-Tempering) or by micro-alloying additions. At the end of the rolling operation, the rebar is cut to the required length, generally bundled and labelled. The data used represent >95% of annual production with 2019 data for deliveries.

Steel scrap is assumed to reach the end-of-waste status once is shredded and sorted, thus becomes input to the product system in the inventory. Module C3 takes into account the sorting and shredding of after-use steel to allow its orientation towards the recycling solutions. This process will also produce losses due to efficiency that will be oriented towards landfill sites. A conservative value of 1% landfill is then considered in C4. Module C4 takes into account the waste disposal including physical pre-treatment and management of the disposal site.

Stainless steel sheet,Metalle,Edelstahl,Edelstahlbleche,DE,This data set has been modeled according to the European Standard EN 15804 for Sustainable Building. Results are depicted in modules that allow the structured expression of results over the entire life cycle.,No,en,"The data set represents the stainless steel production in Germany based on the main production steps which take place within an electric steelmaking plant. The main process step hereby is the melting of stainless steel scrap in the electric arc furnace (EAF), thus the consumed energy is mainly electric power.   The major feed stock for the EAF is stainless steel scrap, which may comprise of scrap from inside the steelworks (e.g. cut-offs), cut-offs from steel product manufacturers (e.g. vehicle builders) and post-consumer scrap (e.g. end of life products). As in the integrated steel plant including blast furnaces and converters, a slag is formed from lime to collect undesirable components in the steel. Thus lime is an additive as well as coal (carbon) as reducing agent and alloying elements. Oxygen lances and / or oxy-fuel burners are used to assist in the early stages of melting.  For every material fraction the transport is considered in the data set.   For the production of carbon steel and low alloyed steels, following main operations are performed: raw material handling and storage, furnace charging with/without scrap preheating, EAF scrap melting, steel and slag tapping, ladle furnace treatments for quality adjustment, slag handling and finally continuous casting.   For high alloyed respectively stainless steels, the operation sequence is more complex and tailor-made for the end-products. In addition to the mentioned operations for carbon steels various ladle treatments (secondary metallurgy) are carried out like desulphurisation, degassing for the elimination of dissolved gases like nitrogen and hydrogen, decarburisation (AOD=Argon-Oxygen-Decarburisation or VOD=Vacuum-Oxygen-Decarburisation).  The following operations are two rolling processes: the hot strip mill and the cold rolling mill. In the hot rolling mill the slab is reshaped above the recrystallization temperature. The qualities obtained in this process are e.g. strength and surface quality. During the rolling process the material passes through the furnace and the rolling line. In the furnace the metal is preheated by natural gas. There is no need for an additional warming, if the hot slabs are directly charged into the rolling mill. The forming is done in various rolling frames until the final shape is obtained. The steel scrap in this process are directly recycled.  In the cold rolling mill the material is reshaped below the recrystallization temperature. Thereby a enhanced surface quality, an improved dimensional accuracy as well as a higher strength are achieved. The different process steps are: pickling, the rolling line and the heat treatment.

Background system: Electricity: Electricity is modelled according to the individual country-specific situations. The country-specific modelling is achieved on multiple levels.

Thirdly, the country-specific energy carrier supply (share of imports and / or domestic supply) including the country-specific energy carrier properties (e.g. element and energy content) are accounted for. Fourthly, the exploration, mining/production, processing and transport processes of the energy carrier supply chains are modelled according to the specific situation of each electricity producing country. The different production and processing techniques (emissions and efficiencies) in the different energy producing countries are considered, e.g. different crude oil production technologies or different flaring rates at the oil platforms. Thermal energy, process steam: The thermal energy and process steam supply is modelled according to the individual country-specific situation with regard to emission standards and considered energy carriers. The thermal energy and process steam are produced at heat plants. Efficiencies for thermal energy production are by definition 100% in relation to the corresponding energy carrier input.

"Joint sealing strips, PE/PP foil",Komponenten von Fenstern und Vorhangfassaden,Dichtungskomponenten / -materialien,Fugendichtungsbänder,DE,This data set has been modeled according to the European Standard EN 15804 for Sustainable Building. Results are depicted in modules that allow the structured expression of results over the entire life cycle.,No,en,"The LCA of joint sealing strips made of polyethylene covers the cradle-to-gate phase, that is, particularly the process of the production of plastic using PE granulate. The system boundaries are represented by the finished plastic product. Transports from the factory to the building site are not considered and must be included according to the system boundaries. Production of polyethylene: The basis for the production of polyethylene is crude oil. There are a few process types for polymerising ethylene to polyethylene. Polyethylene is polymerised from ethylene, which is extracted by cracking naphtha or gas oil in a steam-cracker. In principle low density polyethylene (PE-LD) is traditionally produced by a high-pressure process. This extremely high pressure calls for specialist technology and many key features and details are treated as internal information. The design of these thick-walled tubes differs largely from that of the low-pressure vessels. The wearing properties of components such as pumps and compressors must be given special attention on account of the high pressure. The seals are matched to the requirements of the higher pressure. Ethylene is introduced from the pipeline at approx. 5 MPa and compressed to 25 MPa. After the primary compressor stage and input of the recycled ethylene the pressure is increased to 150 - 350 MPa in the secondary compressor stage. The reaction pressure in the reactor is automatically controlled by a pressure control valve at the reactor output. The polymerised reactant mixture is then passed through a heat exchanger and cooled. The polymer temperature drops and the product can be forwarded to the pellet extruder. The polymer is now freed from the main share of the unreacted monomer. This takes place in an interim separator at 25-30 MPa. This pressure stage should be seen as a compromise between separation efficiency and compression energy savings. The separated monomer passes through a number of coolers and separators and recycled. The monomer still in the product is separated in a low-pressure separator and returned to the primary compressor. The polymer is then forwarded to an extruder. The pellets are subsequently dried, stored temporarily to remove volatile remaining monomers and their quality checked. They are then conveyed to a silo, mixed, stored and packed in tanks or bags. The plasticised plastic granulate from the extruder is fed in the calender, which is a system of 3 or 4 counter-revolving cylinders. The plastic film has a gauge of about 0.1 to 0.5 mm. Between 0 and 4 % scrap occurs.  Background system: Electricity: Electricity is modelled according to the individual country-specific situations.

The product is manufactured through the blast furnace-basic oxygen furnace (BF-BOF) route. Coke and iron ore (normally sinter produced from iron ore and limestone) are both fed into the blast furnace from the top; simultaneously, hot air and pulverised coal or natural gas (hydrogen is experimentally being used) are injected through pipes in the side of the lower part of the furnace called tuyeres. This results in a counter-cyclical process of descending iron ore met by rising reducing gases. Lime fluxes and other additives are also used in the blast furnace in varying quantities to control the level of impurities and the temperature. The blast furnace produces molten iron (“hot metal”) at temperatures up to 1400-1 500°C. The hot metal is then fed to the BOF, often in conjunction with some scrap, where oxygen is injected to lower the carbon content from approximately 4-5% to the required level of carbon for the steel grade produced. The produced liquid steel is then refined in a ladle furnace with addition of ferroalloys and metals to obtain the required steel characteristics. The steel is then casted at a continuous caster to obtain semi-finished products such as billets, blooms or slabs. The following operations are two rolling processes: the hot strip mill and the cold rolling mill. In the hot rolling mill the slab is reshaped above the recrystallization temperature. The qualities obtained in this process are e.g. strength and surface quality. During the rolling process the material passes through the furnace and the rolling line. In the furnace the metal is preheated by natural gas. There is no need for an additional warming, if the hot slabs are directly charged into the rolling mill. The forming is done in various rolling frames until the final shape is obtained. The steel scrap in this process are directly recycled. In the cold rolling mill the material is reshaped below the recrystallization temperature. Thereby a enhanced surface quality, an improved dimensional accuracy as well as a higher strength are achieved. The different process steps are: pickling, the rolling line and the heat treatment.  Technical data:  This EPD is valid for cold formed steel sheet piles of varied grades and geometries, as well as different forms of delivery.

The LCA is dominated by the upstream chain of the slaked lime.   Background system: Electricity: Electricity from renewable and non- renewable powerplants is modelled so that it represents a countrys specific consumption mix including transmission / distribution losses, own consumption, imports, emissions and efficiency standards, and energy carrier properties. Several factors are taken into account. (1) Energy carrier production - The exploration, mining / production, processing, and transportation of energy carrier supply chains are modelled for each country. The models account for differences among countries in production and processing, including crude oil production technologies, flaring rates, production efficiencies, emissions, etc. (2) Energy carrier supply - Each countrys specific energy carrier supply is modelled, taking into account domestic supply versus imports from abroad. Energy carrier properties (e.g. carbon and energy content), which can vary depending from where an energy carrier is sourced, are adjusted accordingly. (3) Power plants - Models are created to represent energy carrier-specific power plants and electricity generation facilities specific to different renewable energy resources. Energy carrier production and supply models are used to represent power plant inputs. Combined heat and power (CHP) plants are also considered. (4) Electricity grid - Models representing the electricity generation facilities are combined into a larger model that reflects a countrys consumption mix. The larger model accounts for a countrys production mix, internal consumption (e.g. pumped storage for hydro power), transmission / distribution losses, and imported electricity. The country model is also adjusted according to national power plant emission and efficiency standards, as well as the countrys share of electricity plants versus CHP facilities.

Rendering and plastering mortars are applied to walls and ceilings in one or more layers as required. Alongside the aesthetic design of the surface, they protect against effects of the weather when used as external renders and provide an even substrate for paint coats and wallpaper when used as internal plasters. In the case of reinforced concrete ceilings and stairs, renders/plasters also serve as fire protection; when porous aggregates are added, they serve as thermal protection.

Steel pipe,Gebäudetechnik,Heizung,Wärmeverteilung und Abgabe,DE,This data set has been modeled according to the European Standard EN 15804 for Sustainable Building. Results are depicted in modules that allow the structured expression of results over the entire life cycle.,No,en,"Steel pipe for the installation of heatings and gas supply. According to VDI guideline 2067 for steel pipes an average life span of 40 years can be assumed for heating, gas supply and cold water and 25 years for warm water. Steel production: The preparation of the iron ore includes mainly the crushing. The average iron content in the iron ore is 60%. Pellets are small crystallized balls of iron ore. The pelletisation process consists of grinding and drying, balling and induration followed by screening and handling. The provision of hard coal is described in the respective documentation file (please see link below).  For every fraction the transport to Germany is considered in the data set. The transportation includes all necessary transportation means like ship and where required railway.  The coke oven produces as main product coke out of hard coal. The main by-product resulting from this operation is coke oven gas (COG gas) which is used as energy carrier within the steel production. Further by-products as tar, benzene and sulphur are sold and therefore excluded from the system by allocation to (net) calorific value.  In the sinter plant sinter feed is produced based on the major inputs coke, iron ore and additives. Sintering is an agglomeration process which takes place under high temperatures. The raw materials (fine iron ore, coke breeze, additives) are blended, then the coke breeze is ignited. The result of the sinter process is the so-called sinter cake which has to be broken up, screened and cooled down.  The blast furnace is a closed system into which iron bearing materials (iron ore lump, sinter and / or pellets), additives (slag formers such as limestone) and reducing agents (coke) are continuously fed from the top of the furnace shaft through a charging system. A hot air blast, enriched with oxygen and auxiliary reducing agents (e.g. pulverized coal) is injected providing a counter-current of reducing gases. The air blast reacts with the reducing agents to produce mainly carbon monoxide which in turn reduces iron oxides to metal iron. The main products of the blast furnace operation are hot metal, blast furnace gas (BF gas) and blast furnace slag (BF slag). The BF gas is used as fuel for heating comparable to the COG gas or for electricity production.  The objective in oxygen steelmaking is to burn (i.e., oxidise) the undesirable impurities contained in the metallic feedstock. The main elements thus converted into oxides are carbon, silicon, manganese, phosphorus and sulphur. The purpose of this oxidation process, therefore, are to reduce the carbon content to a specified level to adjust the contents of desirable foreign elements and to remove undesirable impurities to the greatest possible extent. The production of steel by the basic oxygen furnace (BOF) process is a discontinuous process which involves the following steps: transfer and storage of hot metal, pre-treatment of hot metal (desulphurisation), oxidation in the BOF (decarburisation and oxidation of impurities) and secondary metallurgical treatment (e.g. vacuum treatment and adding alloying elements). Within the main step of the oxygen steelmaking, the hot metal feeds together with steel scrap the converter. The main products of the converter are the liquid steel, the converter gas or basic oxygen furnace gas (BOF gas) and the BOF slag. The gas is as well used as energy carrier within the steel production.  Afterwards the continuous casting takes place whereby the liquid steel is cast in continuous strand. The output of the continuous casting process is the slab.  The following operations are two rolling processes: the hot strip mill and the cold rolling mill. In the hot rolling mill the slab is reshaped above the recrystallization temperature. The qualities obtained in this process are e.g. strength and surface quality. During the rolling process the material passes through the furnace and the rolling line. In the furnace the metal is preheated by natural gas. There is no need for an additional warming, if the hot slabs are directly charged into the rolling mill. The forming is done in various rolling frames until the final shape is obtained. The steel scrap in this process are directly recycled.  In the cold rolling mill the material is reshaped below the recrystallization temperature. Thereby a enhanced surface quality, an improved dimensional accuracy as well as a higher strength are achieved.

Steel sheet (0.3-30mm),Metalle,Stahl und Eisen,Stahlbleche,DE,This data set has been modeled according to the European Standard EN 15804 for Sustainable Building. Results are depicted in modules that allow the structured expression of results over the entire life cycle.,No,en,"The data set represents the steel production in Germany based on the main production steps which take place within an integrated steel plant. These production steps as well as the main upstream process steps are described in the following.  The main primary products are iron ore, pellets and hard coal. The import mix for the German steel production concerning iron ore and pellets is: Canada 50%, Brazil 25%, Australia 25%. The import mix for the German steel production concerning hard coal is: 100% Canada. The iron ore mining is explained in detail in the respective documentation file (please see link below). The preparation of the iron ore includes mainly the crushing. The average iron content in the iron ore is 60%. Pellets are small crystallized balls of iron ore. The pelletisation process consists of grinding and drying, balling and induration followed by screening and handling. The provision of hard coal is described in the respective documentation file (please see link below).  For every fraction the transport to Germany is considered in the data set. The transportation includes all necessary transportation means like ship and where required railway.  The coke oven produces as main product coke out of hard coal. The main by-product resulting from this operation is coke oven gas (COG gas) which is used as energy carrier within the steel production. Further by-products as tar, benzene and sulphur are sold and therefore excluded from the system by allocation to (net) calorific value.  In the sinter plant sinter feed is produced based on the major inputs coke, iron ore and additives. Sintering is an agglomeration process which takes place under high temperatures. The raw materials (fine iron ore, coke breeze, additives) are blended, then the coke breeze is ignited. The result of the sinter process is the so-called sinter cake which has to be broken up, screened and cooled down.  The blast furnace is a closed system into which iron bearing materials (iron ore lump, sinter and / or pellets), additives (slag formers such as limestone) and reducing agents (coke) are continuously fed from the top of the furnace shaft through a charging system. A hot air blast, enriched with oxygen and auxiliary reducing agents (e.g. pulverized coal) is injected providing a counter-current of reducing gases. The air blast reacts with the reducing agents to produce mainly carbon monoxide which in turn reduces iron oxides to metal iron. The main products of the blast furnace operation are hot metal, blast furnace gas (BF gas) and blast furnace slag (BF slag). The BF gas is used as fuel for heating comparable to the COG gas or for electricity production.  The objective in oxygen steelmaking is to burn (i.e., oxidise) the undesirable impurities contained in the metallic feedstock. The main elements thus converted into oxides are carbon, silicon, manganese, phosphorus and sulphur. The purpose of this oxidation process, therefore, are to reduce the carbon content to a specified level to adjust the contents of desirable foreign elements and to remove undesirable impurities to the greatest possible extent. The production of steel by the basic oxygen furnace (BOF) process is a discontinuous process which involves the following steps: transfer and storage of hot metal, pre-treatment of hot metal (desulphurisation), oxidation in the BOF (decarburisation and oxidation of impurities) and secondary metallurgical treatment (e.g. vacuum treatment and adding alloying elements). Within the main step of the oxygen steelmaking, the hot metal feeds together with steel scrap the converter. The main products of the converter are the liquid steel, the converter gas or basic oxygen furnace gas (BOF gas) and the BOF slag. The gas is as well used as energy carrier within the steel production.  Afterwards the continuous casting takes place whereby the liquid steel is cast in continuous strand. The output of the continuous casting process is the slab.  The following operations are two rolling processes: the hot strip mill and the cold rolling mill. In the hot rolling mill the slab is reshaped above the recrystallization temperature. The qualities obtained in this process are e.g. strength and surface quality. During the rolling process the material passes through the furnace and the rolling line. In the furnace the metal is preheated by natural gas. There is no need for an additional warming, if the hot slabs are directly charged into the rolling mill. The forming is done in various rolling frames until the final shape is obtained. The steel scrap in this process are directly recycled.  In the cold rolling mill the material is reshaped below the recrystallization temperature. Thereby a enhanced surface quality, an improved dimensional accuracy as well as a higher strength are achieved. The different process steps are: pickling, the rolling line and the heat treatment.  The cold rolled sheet is transferred to the hot-dip galvanising. The zinc coating is applied by dipping the sheet steel into a hot zinc bath. During the hot-dip galvanising the cold rolled sheet passes the following process steps: preheating furnace (organic impurities are burned off), reduction zone (the sheet is heated to cause recrystallization), cooling and homogenization as well as metal bath (coating of the sheet)  and finishing stand.    Background system: Electricity: Electricity is modelled according to the individual country-specific situations.

According to VDI guideline 2067 for steel pipes an average life span of 40 years can be assumed for heating, gas supply and cold water and 25 years for warm water. Steel production: The preparation of the iron ore includes mainly the crushing. The average iron content in the iron ore is 60%. Pellets are small crystallized balls of iron ore. The pelletisation process consists of grinding and drying, balling and induration followed by screening and handling. The provision of hard coal is described in the respective documentation file (please see link below).  For every fraction the transport to Germany is considered in the data set. The transportation includes all necessary transportation means like ship and where required railway.  The coke oven produces as main product coke out of hard coal. The main by-product resulting from this operation is coke oven gas (COG gas) which is used as energy carrier within the steel production. Further by-products as tar, benzene and sulphur are sold and therefore excluded from the system by allocation to (net) calorific value.  In the sinter plant sinter feed is produced based on the major inputs coke, iron ore and additives. Sintering is an agglomeration process which takes place under high temperatures. The raw materials (fine iron ore, coke breeze, additives) are blended, then the coke breeze is ignited. The result of the sinter process is the so-called sinter cake which has to be broken up, screened and cooled down.  The blast furnace is a closed system into which iron bearing materials (iron ore lump, sinter and / or pellets), additives (slag formers such as limestone) and reducing agents (coke) are continuously fed from the top of the furnace shaft through a charging system. A hot air blast, enriched with oxygen and auxiliary reducing agents (e.g. pulverized coal) is injected providing a counter-current of reducing gases. The air blast reacts with the reducing agents to produce mainly carbon monoxide which in turn reduces iron oxides to metal iron. The main products of the blast furnace operation are hot metal, blast furnace gas (BF gas) and blast furnace slag (BF slag). The BF gas is used as fuel for heating comparable to the COG gas or for electricity production.  The objective in oxygen steelmaking is to burn (i.e., oxidise) the undesirable impurities contained in the metallic feedstock. The main elements thus converted into oxides are carbon, silicon, manganese, phosphorus and sulphur. The purpose of this oxidation process, therefore, are to reduce the carbon content to a specified level to adjust the contents of desirable foreign elements and to remove undesirable impurities to the greatest possible extent. The production of steel by the basic oxygen furnace (BOF) process is a discontinuous process which involves the following steps: transfer and storage of hot metal, pre-treatment of hot metal (desulphurisation), oxidation in the BOF (decarburisation and oxidation of impurities) and secondary metallurgical treatment (e.g. vacuum treatment and adding alloying elements). Within the main step of the oxygen steelmaking, the hot metal feeds together with steel scrap the converter. The main products of the converter are the liquid steel, the converter gas or basic oxygen furnace gas (BOF gas) and the BOF slag. The gas is as well used as energy carrier within the steel production.  Afterwards the continuous casting takes place whereby the liquid steel is cast in continuous strand. The output of the continuous casting process is the slab.  The following operations are two rolling processes: the hot strip mill and the cold rolling mill. In the hot rolling mill the slab is reshaped above the recrystallization temperature. The qualities obtained in this process are e.g. strength and surface quality. During the rolling process the material passes through the furnace and the rolling line. In the furnace the metal is preheated by natural gas. There is no need for an additional warming, if the hot slabs are directly charged into the rolling mill. The forming is done in various rolling frames until the final shape is obtained. The steel scrap in this process are directly recycled.  In the cold rolling mill the material is reshaped below the recrystallization temperature. Thereby a enhanced surface quality, an improved dimensional accuracy as well as a higher strength are achieved. The different process steps are: pickling, the rolling line and the heat treatment.  The cold rolled sheet is transferred to the hot-dip galvanising. The zinc coating is applied by dipping the sheet steel into a hot zinc bath. During the hot-dip galvanising the cold rolled sheet passes the following process steps: preheating furnace (organic impurities are burned off), reduction zone (the sheet is heated to cause recrystallization), cooling and homogenization as well as metal bath (coating of the sheet)  and finishing stand. Background system: Electricity: Electricity is modelled according to the individual country-specific situations. The country-specific modelling is achieved on multiple levels. Firstly, individual energy carrier specific power plants and plants for renewable energy sources are modelled according to the current national electricity grid mix. Modelling the electricity consumption mix includes transmission / distribution losses and the own use by energy producers (own consumption of power plants and ""other"" own consumption e.g. due to pumped storage hydro power etc.), as well as imported electricity. Secondly, the national emission and efficiency standards of the power plants are modelled as well as the share of electricity plants and combined heat and power plants (CHP). Thirdly, the country-specific energy carrier supply (share of imports and / or domestic supply) including the country-specific energy carrier properties (e.g. element and energy content) are accounted for. Fourthly, the exploration, mining/production, processing and transport processes of the energy carrier supply chains are modelled according to the specific situation of each electricity producing country. The different production and processing techniques (emissions and efficiencies) in the different energy producing countries are considered, e.g. different crude oil production technologies or different flaring rates at the oil platforms. Thermal energy, process steam: The thermal energy and process steam supply is modelled according to the individual country-specific situation with regard to emission standards and considered energy carriers. The thermal energy and process steam are produced at heat plants. Efficiencies for thermal energy production are by definition 100% in relation to the corresponding energy carrier input. For process steam the efficiency ranges from 85%, 90% to 95%. The energy carriers used for the generation of thermal energy and process steam are modelled according to the specific import situation (see electricity above). Transports: All relevant and known transport processes are included. Ocean-going and inland ship transport as well as rail, truck and pipeline transport of bulk commodities are considered. Energy carriers: The energy carriers are modelled according to the specific supply situation (see electricity above). Refinery products: Diesel fuel, gasoline, technical gases, fuel oils, lubricants and residues such as bitumen are modelled with a parameterised country-specific refinery model. The refinery model represents the current national standard in refining techniques (e.g. emission level, internal energy consumption, etc.) as well as the individual country-specific product output spectrum, which can be quite different from country to country. The supply of crude oil is modelled, again, according to the country-specific situation with the respective properties of the resources.",en,This product can be used in construction.,en,generic dataset,1.0,1.0,Kilogram,Sphera Solutions GmbH,eeda9e75-727c-474d-8c54-3982cafe07d7_20.21.060.xml,"{'A1-A3': 2.54121816164085, 'C2': 0.00881088202126086, 'C4': 0.001625528406734, 'D': -1.30415454982855}",2.54121816164085,2.5412183

Steel forging part,Metalle,Stahl und Eisen,Guss- und Schmiedeteile aus Stahl und Eisen,DE,This data set has been modeled according to the European Standard EN 15804+A2 for Sustainable Building. Results are depicted in modules that allow the structured expression of results over the entire life cycle.,No,en,"The data set represents the steel production in Germany based on the main production steps which take place within an integrated steel plant. These production steps as well as the main upstream process steps are described in the following.  The main primary products are iron ore, pellets and hard coal. The import mix for the German steel production concerning iron ore and pellets is: Canada 50%, Brazil 25%, Australia 25%. The import mix for the German steel production concerning hard coal is: 100% Canada. The iron ore mining is explained in detail in the respective documentation file (please see link below). The preparation of the iron ore includes mainly the crushing. The average iron content in the iron ore is 60%. Pellets are small crystallized balls of iron ore. The pelletisation process consists of grinding and drying, balling and induration followed by screening and handling. The provision of hard coal is described in the respective documentation file (please see link below).  For every fraction the transport to Germany is considered in the data set. The transportation includes all necessary transportation means like ship and where required railway.  The coke oven produces as main product coke out of hard coal. The main by-product resulting from this operation is coke oven gas (COG gas) which is used as energy carrier within the steel production. Further by-products as tar, benzene and sulphur are sold and therefore excluded from the system by allocation to (net) calorific value.  In the sinter plant sinter feed is produced based on the major inputs coke, iron ore and additives. Sintering is an agglomeration process which takes place under high temperatures. The raw materials (fine iron ore, coke breeze, additives) are blended, then the coke breeze is ignited. The result of the sinter process is the so-called sinter cake which has to be broken up, screened and cooled down.  The blast furnace is a closed system into which iron bearing materials (iron ore lump, sinter and / or pellets), additives (slag formers such as limestone) and reducing agents (coke) are continuously fed from the top of the furnace shaft through a charging system. A hot air blast, enriched with oxygen and auxiliary reducing agents (e.g. pulverized coal) is injected providing a counter-current of reducing gases. The air blast reacts with the reducing agents to produce mainly carbon monoxide which in turn reduces iron oxides to metal iron.

The system boundary is the product (ready for sale). Transports from the factory to the mounting location are not taken into account and have to be incorporated in a system approach if necessary. EPDM production: EPDM is produced by the copolymerization of ethylene and propylene. The polymerization is carried out in solution. The process is run at 10- 50°C and 1- 20 bar in a single continuous stirred tank reactor, a catalyst is used. Because the polymerization is strongly exothermal, cooling is required. Organic solvents like hexane are used. Unreacted propene is recycled and reintroduced into the reactor. The solvent is also recovered. Downstream of the reactor, the reaction is shortstopped with water, alcohol or other polar liquids. The polymer solution is mixed with sodium hydroxide to remove catalyst residues. After adding chemicals like extender oil, the polymer solution is stripped with steam and hot water to remove unreacted monomers and solvents.

For pipes or cables which are often flush-mounted a 90% recycling quote is expected. The quotes are only related to metals and plastics. For mineral materials like mineral wool, concrete or ceramics inert landfilling is assumed, as well as for 5-10% of metals and plastics (e.g. cable waste and pipe pieces) that are not recycled. Plastics that are not recycled are introduced to the municipal waste incineration. For the MWI a European model with average emission values and energy production rates was used. Depending on the incinerated type of plastic, different processes with corresponding elemental compositions were used. Then dataset were set up in collaboration with the Confederation of European Waste-to-Energy Plants (CEWEP) and are available on the website of the European Platform on LCA [EC 2008].

Iron materials (steel sheet, pipes, grey cast iron) already use a share of steel scrap at the production. These values are deducted from the recycled steel material before introduced to the melting to avoid a overvaluation of the credits. For the credits primary steel was used.

A post-treatment (passivation, thin organic coating and/or oiling) can also be applied on the product.  This chemical composition has been selected to provide an excellent corrosion resistance. XCarb® Recycled and Renewably Produced hot dip galvanized steel with Magnelis® Coating is compliant with EN 10346.   The coated steel is available in a very wide range of steel grades (steels for cold forming and deep drawing applications, structural steels and High Strength Low Alloy steels), and coating masses (from 70 to 800 g/m²). ZM is the symbol used in EN 10346 to refer to Zinc Aluminium Magnesium coatings to which Magnelis® coated steel belongs.",No,en,"This Environmental Product Declaration refers to a double-sided hot dip galvanized coated steel, consisting of steel substrate with a specific metallic alloyed zinc coating, Magnelis®, applied by means of a continuous hot dip galvanising process. Magnelis® coated steel is a hot-dip galvanized carbon steel coated on both sides with a zinc-aluminiummagnesium alloy. This alloy, composed of 93.5% zinc, 3.5% aluminium and 3% magnesium, is applied by means of a continuous hot dip galvanising process. The substrates can be made of different steel grades with Magnelis® coating ranging from 90 to 430 g/m²and steel thicknesses ranging between 0.20 mm and 6.0 mm. The product is manufactured by through the secondary route, in which different steel scraps are melted in an electric arc furnace to obtain liquid steel. This steel is then refined in a ladle furnace with addition of ferroalloys and metals to obtain the required steel characteristics. The steel is then casted at a continuous caster to obtain semi-finished products as billet or blooms. These products are then rolled to the desired size. The following operations are two rolling processes: the hot strip mill and the cold rolling mill. In the hot rolling mill the slab is reshaped above the recrystallization temperature. The qualities obtained in this process are e.g. strength and surface quality. During the rolling process the material passes through the furnace and the rolling line. In the furnace the metal is preheated by natural gas. There is no need for an additional warming, if the hot slabs are directly charged into the rolling mill. The forming is done in various rolling frames until the final shape is obtained. The steel scrap in this process are directly recycled. In the cold rolling mill the material is reshaped below the recrystallization temperature. Thereby a enhanced surface quality, an improved dimensional accuracy as well as a higher strength are achieved. The different process steps are: pickling, the rolling line and the heat treatment. The rolled coil can be then metallic coated with Zinc, aluminium and magnesium. This product comes from a production process flow which only uses XCarb® Recycled and Renewably Produced Hot Rolled Coil.  Technical data:  Due to its 3 % magnesium content, XCarb® Recycled and Renewably Produced hot dig galvanized with Magnelis® coating offers self-healing on cut edges and corrosion resistance in chloride and ammonia atmospheres. This high corrosion resistance means that less metallic coating is required to ensure an equivalent corrosion protection than with standard hot dip galvanized steels.  The coating process can apply various thickness of the Zinc Aluminium Magnesium layer, up to 800 g/m² (total of both sides).  Specific mechanical properties are defined for each steel grade used as substrate and measured according to EN ISO 6892. The corrosion resistance performance can be evaluated with different indoor and outdoor tests. One of the most common tests is the ‘Salt Spray Test’ defined according to EN ISO 9227/ASTM B-117.

In so doing, the process of bending the steel sheet, the production of the welding seam as well as all necessary materials and energy expenditures have been considered. Transports from the factory to the building site are not considered and must be included according to the system boundaries. The main process step is the melting of stainless steel scrap in the electric arc furnace (EAF), thus the consumed energy is mainly electric power. The major feed stock for the EAF is stainless steel scrap, which may comprise of scrap from inside the steelworks (e.g. cut-offs), cut-offs from steel product manufacturers (e.g. vehicle builders) and post-consumer scrap (e.g. end of life products). As in the integrated steel plant including blast furnaces and converters, a slag is formed from lime to collect undesirable components in the steel. Thus lime is an additive as well as coal (carbon) as reducing agent and alloying elements. Oxygen lances and / or oxy-fuel burners are used to assist in the early stages of melting.  For every material fraction the transport is considered in the data set.   For the production of carbon steel and low alloyed steels, following main operations are performed: raw material handling and storage, furnace charging with/without scrap preheating, EAF scrap melting, steel and slag tapping, ladle furnace treatments for quality adjustment, slag handling and finally continuous casting.   For high alloyed respectively stainless steels, the operation sequence is more complex and tailor-made for the end-products.

Power and thermal energy produced in the MWI are accounted to the European power- and thermal energy mix. The credits for the metal recycling and the energetic recovery of plastics, as well as the emission and resource consumptions (energy for remelting, incineration emissions, landfilling) are included in the datasets. Iron materials (steel sheet, pipes, grey cast iron) already use a share of steel scrap at the production. These values are deducted from the recycled steel material before introduced to the melting to avoid a overvaluation of the credits. For the credits primary steel was used. Credits for the recycling of rare earth or mercury emissions from fluorescent lamps are not considered due to a lack of information. The assumed transport distance from building to recycling plant/landfilling site or MWI are 50km using a truck. The assumed distance to the steel, copper, and aluminium plant is 200km by train.   Background system: Electricity: Electricity is modelled according to the individual country-specific situations. The country-specific modelling is achieved on multiple levels. Firstly, individual energy carrier specific power plants and plants for renewable energy sources are modelled according to the current national electricity grid mix. Modelling the electricity consumption mix includes transmission / distribution losses and the own use by energy producers (own consumption of power plants and ""other"" own consumption e.g. due to pumped storage hydro power etc.), as well as imported electricity. Secondly, the national emission and efficiency standards of the power plants are modelled as well as the share of electricity plants and combined heat and power plants (CHP). Thirdly, the country-specific energy carrier supply (share of imports and / or domestic supply) including the country-specific energy carrier properties (e.g. element and energy content) are accounted for. Fourthly, the exploration, mining/production, processing and transport processes of the energy carrier supply chains are modelled according to the specific situation of each electricity producing country. The different production and processing techniques (emissions and efficiencies) in the different energy producing countries are considered, e.g. different crude oil production technologies or different flaring rates at the oil platforms. Thermal energy, process steam: The thermal energy and process steam supply is modelled according to the individual country-specific situation with regard to emission standards and considered energy carriers. The thermal energy and process steam are produced at heat plants. Efficiencies for thermal energy production are by definition 100% in relation to the corresponding energy carrier input. For process steam the efficiency ranges from 85%, 90% to 95%. The energy carriers used for the generation of thermal energy and process steam are modelled according to the specific import situation (see electricity above). Transports: All relevant and known transport processes are included. Ocean-going and inland ship transport as well as rail, truck and pipeline transport of bulk commodities are considered. Energy carriers: The energy carriers are modelled according to the specific supply situation (see electricity above). Refinery products: Diesel fuel, gasoline, technical gases, fuel oils, lubricants and residues such as bitumen are modelled with a parameterised country-specific refinery model. The refinery model represents the current national standard in refining techniques (e.g. emission level, internal energy consumption, etc.) as well as the individual country-specific product output spectrum, which can be quite different from country to country. The supply of crude oil is modelled, again, according to the country-specific situation with the respective properties of the resources.",en,This product can be used in construction.,en,generic dataset,1.0,1.0,Kilogram,Sphera Solutions GmbH,3cf1e41b-66b6-4475-b69c-8866e267a02f_20.21.060.xml,"{'A1-A3': 2.57024162962704, 'C2': 0.0067522622904369, 'C3': 2.74353938714245, 'C4': 0.00177729623874836, 'D': -1.0065684729254}",2.57024162962704,2.5702417

REA-plaster is obtained from exhaust emissions from flue gas desulphurisation. Thereby, the sulphur dioxide contained reacts with the additionally added limestone to plaster. REA-plaster is a dihydrate. With supply of thermic energy, the chemically bonded water in dihydrates can be evaporated partly or totally to water. Consequently, alpha and beta hemihydrates are produced. Alpha hemihydrates are the basic material for more rigid plasters, beta hemihydrates for more flexible.

Results are depicted in modules that allow the structured expression of results over the entire life cycle.,No,en,"The data set represents the steel production in Germany based on the main production steps which take place within an integrated steel plant. These production steps as well as the main upstream process steps are described in the following.  The main primary products are iron ore, pellets and hard coal. The import mix for the German steel production concerning iron ore and pellets is: Canada 50%, Brazil 25%, Australia 25%. The import mix for the German steel production concerning hard coal is: 100% Canada. The iron ore mining is explained in detail in the respective documentation file (please see link below). The preparation of the iron ore includes mainly the crushing. The average iron content in the iron ore is 60%. Pellets are small crystallized balls of iron ore. The pelletisation process consists of grinding and drying, balling and induration followed by screening and handling. The provision of hard coal is described in the respective documentation file (please see link below).  For every fraction the transport to Germany is considered in the data set. The transportation includes all necessary transportation means like ship and where required railway.  The coke oven produces as main product coke out of hard coal. The main by-product resulting from this operation is coke oven gas (COG gas) which is used as energy carrier within the steel production. Further by-products as tar, benzene and sulphur are sold and therefore excluded from the system by allocation to (net) calorific value.  In the sinter plant sinter feed is produced based on the major inputs coke, iron ore and additives. Sintering is an agglomeration process which takes place under high temperatures. The raw materials (fine iron ore, coke breeze, additives) are blended, then the coke breeze is ignited. The result of the sinter process is the so-called sinter cake which has to be broken up, screened and cooled down.  The blast furnace is a closed system into which iron bearing materials (iron ore lump, sinter and / or pellets), additives (slag formers such as limestone) and reducing agents (coke) are continuously fed from the top of the furnace shaft through a charging system. A hot air blast, enriched with oxygen and auxiliary reducing agents (e.g. pulverized coal) is injected providing a counter-current of reducing gases. The air blast reacts with the reducing agents to produce mainly carbon monoxide which in turn reduces iron oxides to metal iron. The main products of the blast furnace operation are hot metal, blast furnace gas (BF gas) and blast furnace slag (BF slag). The BF gas is used as fuel for heating comparable to the COG gas or for electricity production.  The objective in oxygen steelmaking is to burn (i.e., oxidise) the undesirable impurities contained in the metallic feedstock. The main elements thus converted into oxides are carbon, silicon, manganese, phosphorus and sulphur. The purpose of this oxidation process, therefore, are to reduce the carbon content to a specified level to adjust the contents of desirable foreign elements and to remove undesirable impurities to the greatest possible extent. The production of steel by the basic oxygen furnace (BOF) process is a discontinuous process which involves the following steps: transfer and storage of hot metal, pre-treatment of hot metal (desulphurisation), oxidation in the BOF (decarburisation and oxidation of impurities) and secondary metallurgical treatment (e.g. vacuum treatment and adding alloying elements). Within the main step of the oxygen steelmaking, the hot metal feeds together with steel scrap the converter. The main products of the converter are the liquid steel, the converter gas or basic oxygen furnace gas (BOF gas) and the BOF slag. The gas is as well used as energy carrier within the steel production.  Afterwards the continuous casting takes place whereby the liquid steel is cast in continuous strand. The output of the continuous casting process is the slab.  The following operations are two rolling processes: the hot strip mill and the cold rolling mill. In the hot rolling mill the slab is reshaped above the recrystallization temperature. The qualities obtained in this process are e.g. strength and surface quality. During the rolling process the material passes through the furnace and the rolling line. In the furnace the metal is preheated by natural gas. There is no need for an additional warming, if the hot slabs are directly charged into the rolling mill. The forming is done in various rolling frames until the final shape is obtained. The steel scrap in this process are directly recycled.  In the hot rolling mill the material is reshaped.    In the disposal phase, mechanical dismantling is accounted for in module C1 for steel products (excavator), for all other metals a manual dismantling is assumed (no loads). Collecting losses are neglected. It is assumed that all metals reach the end of the waste status immediately after dismantling. This means that the loads for processing and the credits for the substitution of primary material are shown in Module D. The transport in module C2 to the treatment plant takes place with a truck (50km). Module D includes loads for sorting, remelting, slag treatment, landfill, filtration of dusts and dross treatment.

According to VDI guideline 2067 for air ventilation ducts an average life span of 20 years can be assumed. It is expected, that the recycling quote of big appliances like boilers, air conditioning, and ventilation systems is 95%. For pipes or cables which are often flush-mounted a 90% recycling quote is expected. The quotes are only related to metals and plastics. For mineral materials like mineral wool, concrete or ceramics inert landfilling is assumed, as well as for 5-10% of metals and plastics (e.g. cable waste and pipe pieces) that are not recycled. Plastics that are not recycled are introduced to the municipal waste incineration. For the MWI a European model with average emission values and energy production rates was used. Depending on the incinerated type of plastic, different processes with corresponding elemental compositions were used. Then dataset were set up in collaboration with the Confederation of European Waste-to-Energy Plants (CEWEP) and are available on the website of the European Platform on LCA [EC 2008]. Power and thermal energy produced in the MWI are accounted to the European power- and thermal energy mix. The credits for the metal recycling and the energetic recovery of plastics, as well as the emission and resource consumptions (energy for remelting, incineration emissions, landfilling) are included in the datasets. Iron materials (steel sheet, pipes, grey cast iron) already use a share of steel scrap at the production. These values are deducted from the recycled steel material before introduced to the melting to avoid a overvaluation of the credits. For the credits primary steel was used.

Background system: Electricity: Electricity is modelled according to the individual country-specific situations. The country-specific modelling is achieved on multiple levels. Firstly, individual energy carrier specific power plants and plants for renewable energy sources are modelled according to the current national electricity grid mix. Modelling the electricity consumption mix includes transmission / distribution losses and the own use by energy producers (own consumption of power plants and ""other"" own consumption e.g. due to pumped storage hydro power etc.), as well as imported electricity. Secondly, the national emission and efficiency standards of the power plants are modelled as well as the share of electricity plants and combined heat and power plants (CHP). Thirdly, the country-specific energy carrier supply (share of imports and / or domestic supply) including the country-specific energy carrier properties (e.g. element and energy content) are accounted for. Fourthly, the exploration, mining/production, processing and transport processes of the energy carrier supply chains are modelled according to the specific situation of each electricity producing country. The different production and processing techniques (emissions and efficiencies) in the different energy producing countries are considered, e.g. different crude oil production technologies or different flaring rates at the oil platforms. Thermal energy, process steam: The thermal energy and process steam supply is modelled according to the individual country-specific situation with regard to emission standards and considered energy carriers. The thermal energy and process steam are produced at heat plants. Efficiencies for thermal energy production are by definition 100% in relation to the corresponding energy carrier input. For process steam the efficiency ranges from 85%, 90% to 95%. The energy carriers used for the generation of thermal energy and process steam are modelled according to the specific import situation (see electricity above). Transports: All relevant and known transport processes are included. Ocean-going and inland ship transport as well as rail, truck and pipeline transport of bulk commodities are considered. Energy carriers: The energy carriers are modelled according to the specific supply situation (see electricity above). Refinery products: Diesel fuel, gasoline, technical gases, fuel oils, lubricants and residues such as bitumen are modelled with a parameterised country-specific refinery model. The refinery model represents the current national standard in refining techniques (e.g. emission level, internal energy consumption, etc.) as well as the individual country-specific product output spectrum, which can be quite different from country to country.

According to VDI guideline 2067 for flat radiators an average life span of 30 years can be assumed. It is expected, that the recycling quote of big appliances like boilers, air conditioning, and ventilation systems is 95%. For pipes or cables which are often flush-mounted a 90% recycling quote is expected. The quotes are only related to metals and plastics. For mineral materials like mineral wool, concrete or ceramics inert landfilling is assumed, as well as for 5-10% of metals and plastics (e.g. cable waste and pipe pieces) that are not recycled. Plastics that are not recycled are introduced to the municipal waste incineration. For the MWI a European model with average emission values and energy production rates was used. Depending on the incinerated type of plastic, different processes with corresponding elemental compositions were used. Then dataset were set up in collaboration with the Confederation of European Waste-to-Energy Plants (CEWEP) and are available on the website of the European Platform on LCA [EC 2008]. Power and thermal energy produced in the MWI are accounted to the European power- and thermal energy mix. The credits for the metal recycling and the energetic recovery of plastics, as well as the emission and resource consumptions (energy for remelting, incineration emissions, landfilling) are included in the datasets. Iron materials (steel sheet, pipes, grey cast iron) already use a share of steel scrap at the production. These values are deducted from the recycled steel material before introduced to the melting to avoid a overvaluation of the credits. For the credits primary steel was used. Credits for the recycling of rare earth or mercury emissions from fluorescent lamps are not considered due to a lack of information. The assumed transport distance from building to recycling plant/landfilling site or MWI are 50km using a truck. The assumed distance to the steel, copper, and aluminium plant is 200km by train.   Background system: Electricity: Electricity is modelled according to the individual country-specific situations. The country-specific modelling is achieved on multiple levels. Firstly, individual energy carrier specific power plants and plants for renewable energy sources are modelled according to the current national electricity grid mix. Modelling the electricity consumption mix includes transmission / distribution losses and the own use by energy producers (own consumption of power plants and ""other"" own consumption e.g. due to pumped storage hydro power etc.), as well as imported electricity. Secondly, the national emission and efficiency standards of the power plants are modelled as well as the share of electricity plants and combined heat and power plants (CHP). Thirdly, the country-specific energy carrier supply (share of imports and / or domestic supply) including the country-specific energy carrier properties (e.g. element and energy content) are accounted for. Fourthly, the exploration, mining/production, processing and transport processes of the energy carrier supply chains are modelled according to the specific situation of each electricity producing country. The different production and processing techniques (emissions and efficiencies) in the different energy producing countries are considered, e.g. different crude oil production technologies or different flaring rates at the oil platforms. Thermal energy, process steam: The thermal energy and process steam supply is modelled according to the individual country-specific situation with regard to emission standards and considered energy carriers. The thermal energy and process steam are produced at heat plants. Efficiencies for thermal energy production are by definition 100% in relation to the corresponding energy carrier input. For process steam the efficiency ranges from 85%, 90% to 95%. The energy carriers used for the generation of thermal energy and process steam are modelled according to the specific import situation (see electricity above). Transports: All relevant and known transport processes are included. Ocean-going and inland ship transport as well as rail, truck and pipeline transport of bulk commodities are considered. Energy carriers: The energy carriers are modelled according to the specific supply situation (see electricity above). Refinery products: Diesel fuel, gasoline, technical gases, fuel oils, lubricants and residues such as bitumen are modelled with a parameterised country-specific refinery model.

As in the integrated steel plant including blast furnaces and converters, a slag is formed from lime to collect undesirable components in the steel. Thus lime is an additive as well as coal (carbon) as reducing agent and alloying elements. Oxygen lances and / or oxy-fuel burners are used to assist in the early stages of melting.  For every material fraction the transport is considered in the data set.   For the production of carbon steel and low alloyed steels, following main operations are performed: raw material handling and storage, furnace charging with/without scrap preheating, EAF scrap melting, steel and slag tapping, ladle furnace treatments for quality adjustment, slag handling and finally continuous casting.   For high alloyed respectively stainless steels, the operation sequence is more complex and tailor-made for the end-products. In addition to the mentioned operations for carbon steels various ladle treatments (secondary metallurgy) are carried out like desulphurisation, degassing for the elimination of dissolved gases like nitrogen and hydrogen, decarburisation (AOD=Argon-Oxygen-Decarburisation or VOD=Vacuum-Oxygen-Decarburisation).  The following operations are two rolling processes: the hot strip mill and the cold rolling mill. In the hot rolling mill the slab is reshaped above the recrystallization temperature. The qualities obtained in this process are e.g. strength and surface quality. During the rolling process the material passes through the furnace and the rolling line. In the furnace the metal is preheated by natural gas. There is no need for an additional warming, if the hot slabs are directly charged into the rolling mill. The forming is done in various rolling frames until the final shape is obtained. The steel scrap in this process are directly recycled.  In the cold rolling mill the material is reshaped below the recrystallization temperature. Thereby a enhanced surface quality, an improved dimensional accuracy as well as a higher strength are achieved. The different process steps are: pickling, the rolling line and the heat treatment.     In the disposal phase, mechanical dismantling is accounted for in module C1 for steel products (excavator), for all other metals a manual dismantling is assumed (no loads). Collecting losses are neglected. It is assumed that all metals reach the end of the waste status immediately after dismantling. This means that the loads for processing and the credits for the substitution of primary material are shown in Module D. The transport in module C2 to the treatment plant takes place with a truck (50km). Module D includes loads for sorting, remelting, slag treatment, landfill, filtration of dusts and dross treatment. Credits are given for the net scrap amount (amount returned minus secondary material content, minus processing losses) for the average material mix (from different alloys).",en,This product can be used in construction.,en,generic dataset,1.0,1.0,Kilogram,Sphera Solutions GmbH,649fd5c6-2c2d-47d9-9a1a-a567673c9fd0_20.21.060.xml,"{'A1-A3': 3.632103216936, 'C1': 0.0, 'C2': 0.00262282845734216, 'D': -0.64762103806123}",3.632103216936,3.6321032

Background system: Electricity: Electricity is modelled according to the individual country-specific situations. The country-specific modelling is achieved on multiple levels. Firstly, individual energy carrier specific power plants and plants for renewable energy sources are modelled according to the current national electricity grid mix. Modelling the electricity consumption mix includes transmission / distribution losses and the own use by energy producers (own consumption of power plants and ""other"" own consumption e.g. due to pumped storage hydro power etc.), as well as imported electricity. Secondly, the national emission and efficiency standards of the power plants are modelled as well as the share of electricity plants and combined heat and power plants (CHP). Thirdly, the country-specific energy carrier supply (share of imports and / or domestic supply) including the country-specific energy carrier properties (e.g. element and energy content) are accounted for. Fourthly, the exploration, mining/production, processing and transport processes of the energy carrier supply chains are modelled according to the specific situation of each electricity producing country. The different production and processing techniques (emissions and efficiencies) in the different energy producing countries are considered, e.g. different crude oil production technologies or different flaring rates at the oil platforms. Thermal energy, process steam: The thermal energy and process steam supply is modelled according to the individual country-specific situation with regard to emission standards and considered energy carriers. The thermal energy and process steam are produced at heat plants. Efficiencies for thermal energy production are by definition 100% in relation to the corresponding energy carrier input. For process steam the efficiency ranges from 85%, 90% to 95%. The energy carriers used for the generation of thermal energy and process steam are modelled according to the specific import situation (see electricity above). Transports: All relevant and known transport processes are included. Ocean-going and inland ship transport as well as rail, truck and pipeline transport of bulk commodities are considered. Energy carriers: The energy carriers are modelled according to the specific supply situation (see electricity above).

The energy consumed by the endothermic reaction is delivered by burning coke. The kilns used are usually vertical- shaft furnaces. At the top, a mixture of limestone and coke enters the furnace. The first step is the preheating zone which is about 800°C hot. As the limestone- fuel- mixtures moves down, it reaches the calcining zone. There, temperatures are 1200- 1300°C caused by the combustion of the fuel. Air is introduced to make the combustion possible. In the calcining zone, the decomposition of limestone takes place.

All glass constituents (recycled glass, sand, sodium carbonate, feldspar, sodium sulfate, sodium nitrate, iron oxide, and FOAMGLAS®-scrap) are melted (at ca. 1250°C) in the furnace and drawn into the shape of a thin-walled tube to enable efficient grinding. Melted glass from the melter furnace is put in grinders to produce fine glass powder. In the grinding process, additives are added so that afterwards, glass foaming processes can be envisaged. In the foaming furnace, cellular glass blocks are made in moulds by heating (sintering towards ca 850°C) the glass powder after the grinding process. After the foaming process, the annealing process starts by moving the foamed blocks on the lehr where they cool according to a precisely determined curve. The cooled blocks are cut into rectangular blocks and if necessary, ground or cut to thinner sizes. The produced material is released, labelled, marked, and packed for commercialisation and various end-use applications (roof, wall, facade and other construction elements). 1 Mixing and batching of the raw materials: Recycled glass, feldspar, sodium carbonate, iron oxide, manganese oxide, sodium sulphate, sodium nitrate. 2 The melting furnace has a constant temperature of 1250°C. 3 Molten glass is drawn out of the furnace. 4 Control room for monitoring the production. 5 The glass is drawn off and falls onto the conveyor band where it cools down before entering the ball mill. 6 Addition of ""carbon black"". 7 Ball mill grinds all ingredients into a fine powder before putting them into stainless steel moulds. 8 The filled moulds pass through a cellulating oven (foaming furnace) with a temperature of 850°C.

Results are depicted in modules that allow the structured expression of results over the entire life cycle.,No,en,"The data set represents the steel production in Germany based on the main production steps which take place within an integrated steel plant. These production steps as well as the main upstream process steps are described in the following.  The main primary products are iron ore, pellets and hard coal. The import mix for the German steel production concerning iron ore and pellets is: Canada 50%, Brazil 25%, Australia 25%. The import mix for the German steel production concerning hard coal is: 100% Canada. The iron ore mining is explained in detail in the respective documentation file (please see link below). The preparation of the iron ore includes mainly the crushing. The average iron content in the iron ore is 60%. Pellets are small crystallized balls of iron ore. The pelletisation process consists of grinding and drying, balling and induration followed by screening and handling. The provision of hard coal is described in the respective documentation file (please see link below).  For every fraction the transport to Germany is considered in the data set. The transportation includes all necessary transportation means like ship and where required railway.  The coke oven produces as main product coke out of hard coal. The main by-product resulting from this operation is coke oven gas (COG gas) which is used as energy carrier within the steel production. Further by-products as tar, benzene and sulphur are sold and therefore excluded from the system by allocation to (net) calorific value.  In the sinter plant sinter feed is produced based on the major inputs coke, iron ore and additives. Sintering is an agglomeration process which takes place under high temperatures. The raw materials (fine iron ore, coke breeze, additives) are blended, then the coke breeze is ignited. The result of the sinter process is the so-called sinter cake which has to be broken up, screened and cooled down.  The blast furnace is a closed system into which iron bearing materials (iron ore lump, sinter and / or pellets), additives (slag formers such as limestone) and reducing agents (coke) are continuously fed from the top of the furnace shaft through a charging system. A hot air blast, enriched with oxygen and auxiliary reducing agents (e.g. pulverized coal) is injected providing a counter-current of reducing gases. The air blast reacts with the reducing agents to produce mainly carbon monoxide which in turn reduces iron oxides to metal iron. The main products of the blast furnace operation are hot metal, blast furnace gas (BF gas) and blast furnace slag (BF slag). The BF gas is used as fuel for heating comparable to the COG gas or for electricity production.  The objective in oxygen steelmaking is to burn (i.e., oxidise) the undesirable impurities contained in the metallic feedstock. The main elements thus converted into oxides are carbon, silicon, manganese, phosphorus and sulphur. The purpose of this oxidation process, therefore, are to reduce the carbon content to a specified level to adjust the contents of desirable foreign elements and to remove undesirable impurities to the greatest possible extent. The production of steel by the basic oxygen furnace (BOF) process is a discontinuous process which involves the following steps: transfer and storage of hot metal, pre-treatment of hot metal (desulphurisation), oxidation in the BOF (decarburisation and oxidation of impurities) and secondary metallurgical treatment (e.g. vacuum treatment and adding alloying elements). Within the main step of the oxygen steelmaking, the hot metal feeds together with steel scrap the converter. The main products of the converter are the liquid steel, the converter gas or basic oxygen furnace gas (BOF gas) and the BOF slag. The gas is as well used as energy carrier within the steel production.  Afterwards the continuous casting takes place whereby the liquid steel is cast in continuous strand. The output of the continuous casting process is the slab.  The following operations are two rolling processes: the hot strip mill and the cold rolling mill. In the hot rolling mill the slab is reshaped above the recrystallization temperature. The qualities obtained in this process are e.g. strength and surface quality. During the rolling process the material passes through the furnace and the rolling line. In the furnace the metal is preheated by natural gas. There is no need for an additional warming, if the hot slabs are directly charged into the rolling mill. The forming is done in various rolling frames until the final shape is obtained. The steel scrap in this process are directly recycled.  In the cold rolling mill the material is reshaped below the recrystallization temperature. Thereby a enhanced surface quality, an improved dimensional accuracy as well as a higher strength are achieved. The different process steps are: pickling, the rolling line and the heat treatment.  The cold rolled sheet is transferred to the hot-dip galvanising. The zinc coating is applied by dipping the sheet steel into a hot zinc bath. During the hot-dip galvanising the cold rolled sheet passes the following process steps: preheating furnace (organic impurities are burned off), reduction zone (the sheet is heated to cause recrystallization), cooling and homogenization as well as metal bath (coating of the sheet)  and finishing stand.     In the disposal phase, mechanical dismantling is accounted for in module C1 for steel products (excavator), for all other metals a manual dismantling is assumed (no loads).

Results are depicted in modules that allow the structured expression of results over the entire life cycle.,No,en,"The LCA of joint sealing strips made of polyethylene covers the cradle-to-gate phase, that is, particularly the process of the production of plastic using PE granulate. The system boundaries are represented by the finished plastic product. Transports from the factory to the building site are not considered and must be included according to the system boundaries. Production of polyethylene: The basis for the production of polyethylene is crude oil. There are a few process types for polymerising ethylene to polyethylene. Polyethylene is polymerised from ethylene, which is extracted by cracking naphtha or gas oil in a steam-cracker. In principle low density polyethylene (PE-LD) is traditionally produced by a high-pressure process. This extremely high pressure calls for specialist technology and many key features and details are treated as internal information. The design of these thick-walled tubes differs largely from that of the low-pressure vessels. The wearing properties of components such as pumps and compressors must be given special attention on account of the high pressure. The seals are matched to the requirements of the higher pressure. Ethylene is introduced from the pipeline at approx. 5 MPa and compressed to 25 MPa. After the primary compressor stage and input of the recycled ethylene the pressure is increased to 150 - 350 MPa in the secondary compressor stage. The reaction pressure in the reactor is automatically controlled by a pressure control valve at the reactor output. The polymerised reactant mixture is then passed through a heat exchanger and cooled. The polymer temperature drops and the product can be forwarded to the pellet extruder. The polymer is now freed from the main share of the unreacted monomer. This takes place in an interim separator at 25-30 MPa. This pressure stage should be seen as a compromise between separation efficiency and compression energy savings. The separated monomer passes through a number of coolers and separators and recycled. The monomer still in the product is separated in a low-pressure separator and returned to the primary compressor. The polymer is then forwarded to an extruder. The pellets are subsequently dried, stored temporarily to remove volatile remaining monomers and their quality checked. They are then conveyed to a silo, mixed, stored and packed in tanks or bags. The plasticised plastic granulate from the extruder is fed in the calender, which is a system of 3 or 4 counter-revolving cylinders. The plastic film has a gauge of about 0.1 to 0.5 mm. Between 0 and 4 % scrap occurs.   In module C1, a manual dismantling (no loads) is assumed, collecting losses are neglected.

Acrylic bath and shower tub,Gebäudetechnik,Sanitär,Dusch- und Badewannen,DE,This data set has been modeled according to the European Standard EN 15804+A2 for Sustainable Building. Results are depicted in modules that allow the structured expression of results over the entire life cycle.,No,en,"The acrylic bath or shower tub consists of Polymethylmethacrylat, chip record, epoxy resin and glassesfibers. The useful lifetime of the tub is assumed to be 20 years. It is expected, that the recycling quote of big appliances like boilers, air conditioning, and ventilation systems is 95%. For pipes or cables which are often flush-mounted a 90% recycling quote is expected. The quotes are only related to metals and plastics. For mineral materials like mineral wool, concrete or ceramics inert landfilling is assumed, as well as for 5-10% of metals and plastics (e.g. cable waste and pipe pieces) that are not recycled. Plastics that are not recycled are introduced to the municipal waste incineration. For the MWI a European model with average emission values and energy production rates was used. Depending on the incinerated type of plastic, different processes with corresponding elemental compositions were used. Then dataset were set up in collaboration with the Confederation of European Waste-to-Energy Plants (CEWEP) and are available on the website of the European Platform on LCA [EC 2008]. Power and thermal energy produced in the MWI are accounted to the European power- and thermal energy mix. The credits for the metal recycling and the energetic recovery of plastics, as well as the emission and resource consumptions (energy for remelting, incineration emissions, landfilling) are included in the datasets. Iron materials (steel sheet, pipes, grey cast iron) already use a share of steel scrap at the production. These values are deducted from the recycled steel material before introduced to the melting to avoid a overvaluation of the credits. For the credits primary steel was used. Credits for the recycling of rare earth or mercury emissions from fluorescent lamps are not considered due to a lack of information. The assumed transport distance from building to recycling plant/landfilling site or MWI are 50km using a truck. The assumed distance to the steel, copper, and aluminium plant is 200km by train.   Background system: Electricity: Electricity is modelled according to the individual country-specific situations. The country-specific modelling is achieved on multiple levels. Firstly, individual energy carrier specific power plants and plants for renewable energy sources are modelled according to the current national electricity grid mix. Modelling the electricity consumption mix includes transmission / distribution losses and the own use by energy producers (own consumption of power plants and ""other"" own consumption e.g. due to pumped storage hydro power etc.), as well as imported electricity. Secondly, the national emission and efficiency standards of the power plants are modelled as well as the share of electricity plants and combined heat and power plants (CHP). Thirdly, the country-specific energy carrier supply (share of imports and / or domestic supply) including the country-specific energy carrier properties (e.g. element and energy content) are accounted for. Fourthly, the exploration, mining/production, processing and transport processes of the energy carrier supply chains are modelled according to the specific situation of each electricity producing country. The different production and processing techniques (emissions and efficiencies) in the different energy producing countries are considered, e.g. different crude oil production technologies or different flaring rates at the oil platforms. Thermal energy, process steam: The thermal energy and process steam supply is modelled according to the individual country-specific situation with regard to emission standards and considered energy carriers. The thermal energy and process steam are produced at heat plants. Efficiencies for thermal energy production are by definition 100% in relation to the corresponding energy carrier input. For process steam the efficiency ranges from 85%, 90% to 95%. The energy carriers used for the generation of thermal energy and process steam are modelled according to the specific import situation (see electricity above). Transports: All relevant and known transport processes are included. Ocean-going and inland ship transport as well as rail, truck and pipeline transport of bulk commodities are considered. Energy carriers: The energy carriers are modelled according to the specific supply situation (see electricity above). Refinery products: Diesel fuel, gasoline, technical gases, fuel oils, lubricants and residues such as bitumen are modelled with a parameterised country-specific refinery model. The refinery model represents the current national standard in refining techniques (e.g. emission level, internal energy consumption, etc.) as well as the individual country-specific product output spectrum, which can be quite different from country to country.

Results are depicted in modules that allow the structured expression of results over the entire life cycle.,No,en,"This dataset represents the German tap water mix. 70% of the German tap water mix stems from groundwater, 30% from surface water.  Groundwater has a higher quality than surface water. But it can still contain chemicals from agricultury, landfills, etc. which have to be removed. The purification of groundwater is less complicated than that one of surface water, some of the steps are similar.  Water extracted from lakes or rivers still contains a lot of microbes and hazardous chemicals which have to be removed to make it drinkable.    The Following steps are common to achieve the high quality of drinking water:   Clarification: Silt, algae, colour, manganese and other matter from raw water.  A coagulant like aluminium or iron salt is used to coagulate the undesired matter from the water which can then easily be removed by sedimentation or flotation.  Filtration: Particles are removed by using filters during this stage. There is a variety of different filter types, two examples are a bed of sand and a membrane filter.   Disinfection: All hazardous microbes have to be removed. The most common method for disinfection is using chlorine. After the disinfection, a small amount of chlorine often remains in the water to keep the water safe during the transport. Other disinfection methods are using ozone or UV radiation.   Ion exchange: This process can be used to remove undesired ions from the water.   Activated carbon: Can be used to remove organics.

Results are depicted in modules that allow the structured expression of results over the entire life cycle.,No,en,"SML pipes are cast pipes that are produced by a centrifugal process. They are produced in nominal diameters of DN 80 to DN 2000 and in lengths from 6 - 8m. In the process known as De Lavaud, the pipes are produced in chill-moulds which are cooled with water from the outside. The space between the sand core and the chill-mould is filled with 1400°C hot iron and the machine begins to move. The interaction of longitudinal and radial motion and the centrifugal force on the fluid iron allows the pipe to form on the wall of the chill-mould.  The iron cools down, solidifies and shrinks. The pipes are subsequently thermally treated. They are layered with epoxy resin on the inside and acrylic paint on the outside.  The most important inputs during production of the SML pipes are therefore gray iron (manufactured from secondary metals), thermal energy and power.      In the disposal phase, mechanical dismantling is accounted for in module C1 for steel products (excavator), for all other metals a manual dismantling is assumed (no loads). Collecting losses are neglected. It is assumed that all metals reach the end of the waste status immediately after dismantling. This means that the loads for processing and the credits for the substitution of primary material are shown in Module D.

The major feed stock for the EAF is ferrous scrap, which may comprise of scrap from inside the steelworks (e.g. cut-offs), cut-offs from steel product manufacturers (e.g. vehicle builders) and post-consumer scrap (e.g. end of life products). As in the integrated steel plant including blast furnaces and converters, a slag is formed from lime to collect undesirable components in the steel. Thus lime is an additive as well as coal (carbon) as reducing agent. Oxygen lances and / or oxy-fuel burners are used to assist in the early stages of melting.  For every material fraction the transport is considered in the data set.   For the production of carbon steel and low alloyed steels, following main operations are performed: raw material handling and storage, furnace charging with/without scrap preheating, EAF scrap melting, steel and slag tapping, ladle furnace treatments for quality adjustment, slag handling and finally continuous casting. The output of the continuous casting is the steel slab.  Afterwards the slab is manufactured in a wire drawing process. The main property of reinforced steel is its bond with the surrounded concrete. To improve the bond the wire is ribbed.        In the disposal phase, mechanical dismantling is accounted for in module C1 for steel products (excavator), for all other metals a manual dismantling is assumed (no loads). Collecting losses are neglected. It is assumed that all metals reach the end of the waste status immediately after dismantling. This means that the loads for processing and the credits for the substitution of primary material are shown in Module D. The transport in module C2 to the treatment plant takes place with a truck (50km). Module D includes loads for sorting, remelting, slag treatment, landfill, filtration of dusts and dross treatment.

District heating transfer station,Gebäudetechnik,Heizung,Wärmeerzeuger,DE,This data set has been modeled according to the European Standard EN 15804+A2 for Sustainable Building. Results are depicted in modules that allow the structured expression of results over the entire life cycle.,No,en,"Based on different product descriptions an average mass of 1 kg per kW effective power results for the district heating transfer station . The heat is transferred from the district heating network through a heat exchanger to the building heating. The expected lifetime of the district heating transfer station is 30 years, according to VDI 2067 directive. It is expected, that the recycling quote of big appliances like boilers, air conditioning, and ventilation systems is 95%. For pipes or cables which are often flush-mounted a 90% recycling quote is expected. The quotes are only related to metals and plastics. For mineral materials like mineral wool, concrete or ceramics inert landfilling is assumed, as well as for 5-10% of metals and plastics (e.g. cable waste and pipe pieces) that are not recycled. Plastics that are not recycled are introduced to the municipal waste incineration. For the MWI a European model with average emission values and energy production rates was used. Depending on the incinerated type of plastic, different processes with corresponding elemental compositions were used. Then dataset were set up in collaboration with the Confederation of European Waste-to-Energy Plants (CEWEP) and are available on the website of the European Platform on LCA [EC 2008]. Power and thermal energy produced in the MWI are accounted to the European power- and thermal energy mix. The credits for the metal recycling and the energetic recovery of plastics, as well as the emission and resource consumptions (energy for remelting, incineration emissions, landfilling) are included in the datasets. Iron materials (steel sheet, pipes, grey cast iron) already use a share of steel scrap at the production. These values are deducted from the recycled steel material before introduced to the melting to avoid a overvaluation of the credits. For the credits primary steel was used. Credits for the recycling of rare earth or mercury emissions from fluorescent lamps are not considered due to a lack of information. The assumed transport distance from building to recycling plant/landfilling site or MWI are 50km using a truck. The assumed distance to the steel, copper, and aluminium plant is 200km by train.   Background system: Electricity: Electricity is modelled according to the individual country-specific situations. The country-specific modelling is achieved on multiple levels. Firstly, individual energy carrier specific power plants and plants for renewable energy sources are modelled according to the current national electricity grid mix. Modelling the electricity consumption mix includes transmission / distribution losses and the own use by energy producers (own consumption of power plants and ""other"" own consumption e.g. due to pumped storage hydro power etc.), as well as imported electricity. Secondly, the national emission and efficiency standards of the power plants are modelled as well as the share of electricity plants and combined heat and power plants (CHP). Thirdly, the country-specific energy carrier supply (share of imports and / or domestic supply) including the country-specific energy carrier properties (e.g. element and energy content) are accounted for. Fourthly, the exploration, mining/production, processing and transport processes of the energy carrier supply chains are modelled according to the specific situation of each electricity producing country. The different production and processing techniques (emissions and efficiencies) in the different energy producing countries are considered, e.g. different crude oil production technologies or different flaring rates at the oil platforms. Thermal energy, process steam: The thermal energy and process steam supply is modelled according to the individual country-specific situation with regard to emission standards and considered energy carriers. The thermal energy and process steam are produced at heat plants. Efficiencies for thermal energy production are by definition 100% in relation to the corresponding energy carrier input. For process steam the efficiency ranges from 85%, 90% to 95%. The energy carriers used for the generation of thermal energy and process steam are modelled according to the specific import situation (see electricity above). Transports: All relevant and known transport processes are included. Ocean-going and inland ship transport as well as rail, truck and pipeline transport of bulk commodities are considered. Energy carriers: The energy carriers are modelled according to the specific supply situation (see electricity above). Refinery products: Diesel fuel, gasoline, technical gases, fuel oils, lubricants and residues such as bitumen are modelled with a parameterised country-specific refinery model. The refinery model represents the current national standard in refining techniques (e.g. emission level, internal energy consumption, etc.) as well as the individual country-specific product output spectrum, which can be quite different from country to country.

Buffer storage (stainless steel),Gebäudetechnik,Heizung,Speicher,DE,This data set has been modeled according to the European Standard EN 15804+A2 for Sustainable Building. Results are depicted in modules that allow the structured expression of results over the entire life cycle.,No,en,"The buffer stores hot water for a heating system or hot water supply to avoid starting-up and power down the boiler permanently.  A buffer is imperative for solar systems. According to VDI Richtlinie 2067 an average lifetime of 20 years can be assumed for buffers. It is expected, that the recycling quote of big appliances like boilers, air conditioning, and ventilation systems is 95%. For pipes or cables which are often flush-mounted a 90% recycling quote is expected. The quotes are only related to metals and plastics. For mineral materials like mineral wool, concrete or ceramics inert landfilling is assumed, as well as for 5-10% of metals and plastics (e.g. cable waste and pipe pieces) that are not recycled. Plastics that are not recycled are introduced to the municipal waste incineration. For the MWI a European model with average emission values and energy production rates was used. Depending on the incinerated type of plastic, different processes with corresponding elemental compositions were used. Then dataset were set up in collaboration with the Confederation of European Waste-to-Energy Plants (CEWEP) and are available on the website of the European Platform on LCA [EC 2008]. Power and thermal energy produced in the MWI are accounted to the European power- and thermal energy mix. The credits for the metal recycling and the energetic recovery of plastics, as well as the emission and resource consumptions (energy for remelting, incineration emissions, landfilling) are included in the datasets. Iron materials (steel sheet, pipes, grey cast iron) already use a share of steel scrap at the production. These values are deducted from the recycled steel material before introduced to the melting to avoid a overvaluation of the credits. For the credits primary steel was used. Credits for the recycling of rare earth or mercury emissions from fluorescent lamps are not considered due to a lack of information. The assumed transport distance from building to recycling plant/landfilling site or MWI are 50km using a truck. The assumed distance to the steel, copper, and aluminium plant is 200km by train.   Background system: Electricity: Electricity is modelled according to the individual country-specific situations. The country-specific modelling is achieved on multiple levels. Firstly, individual energy carrier specific power plants and plants for renewable energy sources are modelled according to the current national electricity grid mix. Modelling the electricity consumption mix includes transmission / distribution losses and the own use by energy producers (own consumption of power plants and ""other"" own consumption e.g. due to pumped storage hydro power etc.), as well as imported electricity. Secondly, the national emission and efficiency standards of the power plants are modelled as well as the share of electricity plants and combined heat and power plants (CHP). Thirdly, the country-specific energy carrier supply (share of imports and / or domestic supply) including the country-specific energy carrier properties (e.g. element and energy content) are accounted for. Fourthly, the exploration, mining/production, processing and transport processes of the energy carrier supply chains are modelled according to the specific situation of each electricity producing country. The different production and processing techniques (emissions and efficiencies) in the different energy producing countries are considered, e.g. different crude oil production technologies or different flaring rates at the oil platforms. Thermal energy, process steam: The thermal energy and process steam supply is modelled according to the individual country-specific situation with regard to emission standards and considered energy carriers. The thermal energy and process steam are produced at heat plants. Efficiencies for thermal energy production are by definition 100% in relation to the corresponding energy carrier input. For process steam the efficiency ranges from 85%, 90% to 95%. The energy carriers used for the generation of thermal energy and process steam are modelled according to the specific import situation (see electricity above). Transports: All relevant and known transport processes are included. Ocean-going and inland ship transport as well as rail, truck and pipeline transport of bulk commodities are considered. Energy carriers: The energy carriers are modelled according to the specific supply situation (see electricity above). Refinery products: Diesel fuel, gasoline, technical gases, fuel oils, lubricants and residues such as bitumen are modelled with a parameterised country-specific refinery model. The refinery model represents the current national standard in refining techniques (e.g. emission level, internal energy consumption, etc.) as well as the individual country-specific product output spectrum, which can be quite different from country to country.

XCarb® recycled and renewably produced organic coated steel coils Granite® and Estetic®,Metalle,Stahl und Eisen,Stahlprofile,RER,"This Environmental Product Declaration refers to XCarb® recycled and renewably produced organic coated steel coils from the Granite® and Estetic® range. The Granite® and Estetic® range combines metallic coated steel substrates with a protective organic coating system to create robust colour-coated products with high weathering resistance and therefore longer lifetime.  Granite® & Estetic® prepainted steels are delivered in compliance with standard EN 10169.  These two families of prepainted products are available in a wide range of steel grades aimed for architectural buildings for outdoor use (roofing, cladding) and indoor use (home appliances, general industry and building components) processed by drawing, roll forming, bending, flanging, or spinning.  Granite® & Estetic® prepainted steels are made of a Zinc or Optigal® (respectively Z & ZM according to EN 10346 standard) metallic coated steel with coating weights ranging from 60 to 350 g/m², combined with an additional organic coating with thicknesses as follows:  Top side 25 μm to 75 μm for Granite® and 15 μm to 55 μm for Estetic® Back side 5 μm to 75 μm for Granite® and 5μm to 25 μm for Estetic®  More info available at: https://industry.arcelormittal.com/catalogue#family_f",No,en,"This Environmental Product Declaration refers to organic coated steel coil in the XCarb® renewably and recycled produced Granite® and Estetic® product range. This product comes from a production process flow which only uses XCarb® Recycled and Renewably Produced Hot Rolled Coil. The Granite® and Estetic® range combines metallic coated steel substrates with a protective organic coating system to create robust products with longer life and high resistance. These two types of prepainted products are available in a wide range of steel grades aimed for architectural buildings for outdoor use (roofing , cladding) and indoor use (domestic appliance, industry, building parts) processed by drawing, roll forming, flanging or spinning. Granite® & Estetic® prepainted steels are constituted of a metallic coating with coating masses from 18 to 350 g/m² and an organic coating with thicknesses as follows: Top side 25 μm to 70 μm for Granite® and 15 μm to 55 μm for Estetic®, Back side 5 μm to 70 μm for Granite® and 5 μm to 25 μm for Estetic®. The production is by the secondary route, in which different steel scraps are melted in an electric arc furnace to obtain liquid steel. This steel is then refined in a ladle furnace with addition of ferroalloys and metals to obtain the required steel characteristics. The steel is then casted at a continuous caster to obtain semi-finished products as billet or blooms. These products are then rolled to the desired size. The rib profile is rolled onto the bar in the last stand of the rolling process. The produced liquid steel is then refined in a ladle furnace with addition of ferroalloys and metals to obtain the required steel characteristics. The steel is then casted at a continuous caster to obtain semi-finished products such as billets, blooms or slabs. The following operations are two rolling processes: the hot strip mill and the cold rolling mill. In the hot rolling mill the slab is reshaped above the recrystallization temperature. The qualities obtained in this process are e.g. strength and surface quality. During the rolling process the material passes through the furnace and the rolling line. In the furnace the metal is preheated by natural gas. There is no need for an additional warming, if the hot slabs are directly charged into the rolling mill. The forming is done in various rolling frames until the final shape is obtained. The steel scrap in this process are directly recycled. In the cold rolling mill the material is reshaped below the recrystallization temperature. Thereby a enhanced surface quality, an improved dimensional accuracy as well as a higher strength are achieved. The different process steps are: pickling, the rolling line and the heat treatment. he rolled coil can be then metallic coated with various mixtures of metal coating such as Zn, Al, Mg and Si. After metallic coated, the coil is further organic coated.  Technical data:  The thickness of coatings (i.e. metallic layer and organic coating) varies according to the intended end use of the products. Granite® is suitable for outdoor applications whereas Estetic® is preferred for indoor applications. Granite® and Estetic® products can be processed by bending, profiling, cold roll forming and deep drawing without damaging the top surface. They can be joined using techniques such as clinching, riveting and adhesive bonding. These products are in compliance with EN 10169 standard.

The extraction of the main raw material from the quarry normally takes place in the immediate area of the cement works.  Portland cement (CEM I) is primarily made up of finely ground clinker cement and a smaller amount of ground materials. Other cements may also include constituents such as slag sand (CEM III), natural puzzolan such as trass (CEM IV), fly ash, oil shale burn-out or limestone. The most important agent is the blast furnace cement (CEM III).  Coagulation is controlled with the help of minor constituents, such as calcium sulphate to facilitate its optimal processing in the concrete production.  Clinker cement is made up of a mixture of primary products of mainly calcium oxide, silica, aluminium oxide, and iron oxide. Limestone, chalk and clay (or their naturally occurring mixture of limestone marl) provide these chemical constituents.   The raw material mixture is heated to approximately 1450°C in a rotary furnace until sintering. New bonds are created from the source material, these are known as the clinker phases.

Not included is the production of the metal substrate, which shall be calculated separately. Top coat application: The dataset describes the use of a solvent-based white industrial coating with 35% of organic solvents and 65% solids. The top coat is applicated in a climated spraybooth. The climatisation uses thermal enrgy from natural gas and desalinated water in order to keep the temperature and humidity of the process air in a narrow application window and possibly unaffected from outside weather changes for quality reasons. The amount of energy and water needed for this are strongly dependent on local climate conditions, the data used here is representative for northern Germany inland. The process air contains coating particles (the transfer losses) and therefore needs to be cleaned, which is usually done in a waterwash type filter. For this, coagulation chemicals are needed and evaporated water needs to be replaced by tap water. Waste (coagulated coating sludge) is incinerated in a waste incineration plant because of its energy content. Credits are given for the electricity and steam that are produced there. Rinsing agents are used to clean the coating application system when colours are changed. No waste water is generated, the process is usually run in an effluent free operation mode. The crosslinking of the coating takes place in a drier (an oven), which is usually powered by natural gas. For solvent based coatings, usually a thermal waste air aftertreatment is used for VOC emission control.

Background system: Electricity: Electricity from renewable and non- renewable powerplants is modelled so that it represents a countrys specific consumption mix including transmission / distribution losses, own consumption, imports, emissions and efficiency standards, and energy carrier properties. Several factors are taken into account. (1) Energy carrier production - The exploration, mining / production, processing, and transportation of energy carrier supply chains are modelled for each country. The models account for differences among countries in production and processing, including crude oil production technologies, flaring rates, production efficiencies, emissions, etc. (2) Energy carrier supply - Each countrys specific energy carrier supply is modelled, taking into account domestic supply versus imports from abroad. Energy carrier properties (e.g. carbon and energy content), which can vary depending from where an energy carrier is sourced, are adjusted accordingly. (3) Power plants - Models are created to represent energy carrier-specific power plants and electricity generation facilities specific to different renewable energy resources. Energy carrier production and supply models are used to represent power plant inputs. Combined heat and power (CHP) plants are also considered. (4) Electricity grid - Models representing the electricity generation facilities are combined into a larger model that reflects a countrys consumption mix. The larger model accounts for a countrys production mix, internal consumption (e.g. pumped storage for hydro power), transmission / distribution losses, and imported electricity. The country model is also adjusted according to national power plant emission and efficiency standards, as well as the countrys share of electricity plants versus CHP facilities.

Production of PA 6: Nylon 6 is produced from caprolactam which is synthesized from benzene, ammonia, hydrogen and sulphuric acid (oleum). Via the intermediate products cyclohexane and cyclohexanone, the monomer caprolactam is produced. The Nylon 6 is produced by the reaction of caprolactam with water over producing the intermediate product aminocaproic acid. The acid is formed by ring- opening of caprolactam when water is added.

Some components are not used in all of the 6 models. The average panel system calculates the content of those components by weighing according to how many of the 6 models incorporate the given component.

Hot dip galvanized steel,Metalle,Stahl und Eisen,Stahlbleche,DE,This data set has been modeled according to the European Standard EN 15804 for Sustainable Building. Results are depicted in modules that allow the structured expression of results over the entire life cycle.,No,en,"The data set represents the steel production in Germany based on the main production steps which take place within an integrated steel plant. These production steps as well as the main upstream process steps are described in the following.  The main primary products are iron ore, pellets and hard coal. The import mix for the German steel production concerning iron ore and pellets is: Canada 50%, Brazil 25%, Australia 25%. The import mix for the German steel production concerning hard coal is: 100% Canada. The iron ore mining is explained in detail in the respective documentation file (please see link below). The preparation of the iron ore includes mainly the crushing. The average iron content in the iron ore is 60%. Pellets are small crystallized balls of iron ore. The pelletisation process consists of grinding and drying, balling and induration followed by screening and handling. The provision of hard coal is described in the respective documentation file (please see link below).  For every fraction the transport to Germany is considered in the data set. The transportation includes all necessary transportation means like ship and where required railway.  The coke oven produces as main product coke out of hard coal. The main by-product resulting from this operation is coke oven gas (COG gas) which is used as energy carrier within the steel production. Further by-products as tar, benzene and sulphur are sold and therefore excluded from the system by allocation to (net) calorific value.  In the sinter plant sinter feed is produced based on the major inputs coke, iron ore and additives. Sintering is an agglomeration process which takes place under high temperatures. The raw materials (fine iron ore, coke breeze, additives) are blended, then the coke breeze is ignited. The result of the sinter process is the so-called sinter cake which has to be broken up, screened and cooled down.  The blast furnace is a closed system into which iron bearing materials (iron ore lump, sinter and / or pellets), additives (slag formers such as limestone) and reducing agents (coke) are continuously fed from the top of the furnace shaft through a charging system. A hot air blast, enriched with oxygen and auxiliary reducing agents (e.g. pulverized coal) is injected providing a counter-current of reducing gases. The air blast reacts with the reducing agents to produce mainly carbon monoxide which in turn reduces iron oxides to metal iron. The main products of the blast furnace operation are hot metal, blast furnace gas (BF gas) and blast furnace slag (BF slag). The BF gas is used as fuel for heating comparable to the COG gas or for electricity production.  The objective in oxygen steelmaking is to burn (i.e., oxidise) the undesirable impurities contained in the metallic feedstock. The main elements thus converted into oxides are carbon, silicon, manganese, phosphorus and sulphur. The purpose of this oxidation process, therefore, are to reduce the carbon content to a specified level to adjust the contents of desirable foreign elements and to remove undesirable impurities to the greatest possible extent. The production of steel by the basic oxygen furnace (BOF) process is a discontinuous process which involves the following steps: transfer and storage of hot metal, pre-treatment of hot metal (desulphurisation), oxidation in the BOF (decarburisation and oxidation of impurities) and secondary metallurgical treatment (e.g. vacuum treatment and adding alloying elements). Within the main step of the oxygen steelmaking, the hot metal feeds together with steel scrap the converter. The main products of the converter are the liquid steel, the converter gas or basic oxygen furnace gas (BOF gas) and the BOF slag. The gas is as well used as energy carrier within the steel production.  Afterwards the continuous casting takes place whereby the liquid steel is cast in continuous strand. The output of the continuous casting process is the slab.  The following operations are two rolling processes: the hot strip mill and the cold rolling mill. In the hot rolling mill the slab is reshaped above the recrystallization temperature. The qualities obtained in this process are e.g. strength and surface quality. During the rolling process the material passes through the furnace and the rolling line. In the furnace the metal is preheated by natural gas. There is no need for an additional warming, if the hot slabs are directly charged into the rolling mill. The forming is done in various rolling frames until the final shape is obtained. The steel scrap in this process are directly recycled.  In the cold rolling mill the material is reshaped below the recrystallization temperature. Thereby a enhanced surface quality, an improved dimensional accuracy as well as a higher strength are achieved. The different process steps are: pickling, the rolling line and the heat treatment.  The cold rolled sheet is transferred to the hot-dip galvanising. The zinc coating is applied by dipping the sheet steel into a hot zinc bath. During the hot-dip galvanising the cold rolled sheet passes the following process steps: preheating furnace (organic impurities are burned off), reduction zone (the sheet is heated to cause recrystallization), cooling and homogenization as well as metal bath (coating of the sheet)  and finishing stand.    Background system: Electricity: Electricity is modelled according to the individual country-specific situations.

The system boundary is the product (ready for sale). Transports from the factory to the mounting location are not taken into account and have to be incorporated in a system approach if necessary. Production of EPDM: EPDM is produced by the copolymerization of ethylene and propylene. The polymerization is carried out in solution. The process is run at 10- 50°C and 1- 20 bar in a single continuous stirred tank reactor, a catalyst is used. Because the polymerization is strongly exothermal, cooling is required. Organic solvents like hexane are used. Unreacted propene is recycled and reintroduced into the reactor. The solvent is also recovered. Downstream of the reactor, the reaction is shortstopped with water, alcohol or other polar liquids. The polymer solution is mixed with sodium hydroxide to remove catalyst residues. After adding chemicals like extender oil, the polymer solution is stripped with steam and hot water to remove unreacted monomers and solvents. Antiagglomerants and antifoaming agents may be added to control crumb agglomeration of the rubber product. The product is then passed over a screen and dried. Background system: Electricity: Electricity is modelled according to the individual country-specific situations. The country-specific modelling is achieved on multiple levels. Firstly, individual energy carrier specific power plants and plants for renewable energy sources are modelled according to the current national electricity grid mix. Modelling the electricity consumption mix includes transmission / distribution losses and the own use by energy producers (own consumption of power plants and ""other"" own consumption e.g. due to pumped storage hydro power etc.), as well as imported electricity. Secondly, the national emission and efficiency standards of the power plants are modelled as well as the share of electricity plants and combined heat and power plants (CHP). Thirdly, the country-specific energy carrier supply (share of imports and / or domestic supply) including the country-specific energy carrier properties (e.g. element and energy content) are accounted for. Fourthly, the exploration, mining/production, processing and transport processes of the energy carrier supply chains are modelled according to the specific situation of each electricity producing country. The different production and processing techniques (emissions and efficiencies) in the different energy producing countries are considered, e.g. different crude oil production technologies or different flaring rates at the oil platforms. Thermal energy, process steam: The thermal energy and process steam supply is modelled according to the individual country-specific situation with regard to emission standards and considered energy carriers. The thermal energy and process steam are produced at heat plants. Efficiencies for thermal energy production are by definition 100% in relation to the corresponding energy carrier input. For process steam the efficiency ranges from 85%, 90% to 95%. The energy carriers used for the generation of thermal energy and process steam are modelled according to the specific import situation (see electricity above).

The installation distance is defined through the required heating capacity of the system. Simplified an installation distance of 100mm for sanitary areas and 200 mm for living and office areas is applied. The cross section for tubes wihich are used for underfloor heating systems is between 14 and 20 mm. For the data sets an average value of 17 mm has been used. According to VDI guideline 2067 for underfloor heating systems an average life span of 30 years can be assumed.  It is expected, that the recycling quote of big appliances like boilers, air conditioning, and ventilation systems is 95%. For pipes or cables which are often flush-mounted a 90% recycling quote is expected. The quotes are only related to metals and plastics. For mineral materials like mineral wool, concrete or ceramics inert landfilling is assumed, as well as for 5-10% of metals and plastics (e.g. cable waste and pipe pieces) that are not recycled. Plastics that are not recycled are introduced to the municipal waste incineration. For the MWI a European model with average emission values and energy production rates was used. Depending on the incinerated type of plastic, different processes with corresponding elemental compositions were used. Then dataset were set up in collaboration with the Confederation of European Waste-to-Energy Plants (CEWEP) and are available on the website of the European Platform on LCA [EC 2008]. Power and thermal energy produced in the MWI are accounted to the European power- and thermal energy mix. The credits for the metal recycling and the energetic recovery of plastics, as well as the emission and resource consumptions (energy for remelting, incineration emissions, landfilling) are included in the datasets. Iron materials (steel sheet, pipes, grey cast iron) already use a share of steel scrap at the production. These values are deducted from the recycled steel material before introduced to the melting to avoid a overvaluation of the credits. For the credits primary steel was used. Credits for the recycling of rare earth or mercury emissions from fluorescent lamps are not considered due to a lack of information. The assumed transport distance from building to recycling plant/landfilling site or MWI are 50km using a truck. The assumed distance to the steel, copper, and aluminium plant is 200km by train.

MASTERIMPACT®-RH Fibre-Cement Drywall Panels,Mineralische Baustoffe,Steine und Elemente,Faserzement,BE,This Environmental Product Declaration refers to large-format structural panels comprising cellulose-reinforced fibre-cement panels. The products under review involve smooth panels made from steam-hardened fibre cement.,No,en,"Large-format panels made of fibre cement are manufactured mainly in accordance with an automated winding process. The raw materials are treated with water to form a homogeneous mixture. Rotating screen cylinders are immersed in this fibre cement pulp which drains the mixture outwards. The screen surface is coated with a thin fibre cement film which is conveyed onto an infinite transport belt from where it reaches a format roller to which an increasingly thick layer of fibre cement is applied. Once the requisite material thickness has been achieved, the still moist and malleable fibre cement layer (fibre cement fleece) is unravelled and detached from the format roller. The fibre cement fleece is cut to length and any leftovers are returned to the production process with the result that no waste is incurred. The panels are then set aside for binding before stacking on pallets and steam-hardened in an autoclave for approx. 2 hours. The setting time lasts approx. 3 days.

Not included is the production of the metal substrate, which shall be calculated separately. Top coat application: The dataset describes the use of a water-based white iindustrial coating with 4% of organic solvents and 55% solids. The top coat is applicated in a climated spraybooth. The climatisation uses thermal enrgy from natural gas and desalinated water in order to keep the temperature and humidity of the process air in a narrow application window and possibly unaffected from outside weather changes for quality reasons. The amount of energy and water needed for this are strongly dependent on local climate conditions, the data used here is representative for northern Germany inland. The process air contains coating particles (the transfer losses) and therefore needs to be cleaned, which is usually done in a waterwash type filter. For this, coagulation chemicals are needed and evaporated water needs to be replaced by tap water. Waste (coagulated coating sludge) is incinerated in a waste incineration plant because of its energy content. Credits are given for the electricity and steam that are produced there. Rinsing agents are used to clean the coating application system when colours are changed. No waste water is generated, the process is usually run in an effluent free operation mode.

The cross section for tubes wihich are used for underfloor heating systems is between 14 and 20 mm. For the data sets an average value of 17 mm has been used. According to VDI guideline 2067 for underfloor heating systems an average life span of 30 years can be assumed. It is expected, that the recycling quote of big appliances like boilers, air conditioning, and ventilation systems is 95%. For pipes or cables which are often flush-mounted a 90% recycling quote is expected. The quotes are only related to metals and plastics. For mineral materials like mineral wool, concrete or ceramics inert landfilling is assumed, as well as for 5-10% of metals and plastics (e.g. cable waste and pipe pieces) that are not recycled. Plastics that are not recycled are introduced to the municipal waste incineration. For the MWI a European model with average emission values and energy production rates was used. Depending on the incinerated type of plastic, different processes with corresponding elemental compositions were used. Then dataset were set up in collaboration with the Confederation of European Waste-to-Energy Plants (CEWEP) and are available on the website of the European Platform on LCA [EC 2008]. Power and thermal energy produced in the MWI are accounted to the European power- and thermal energy mix. The credits for the metal recycling and the energetic recovery of plastics, as well as the emission and resource consumptions (energy for remelting, incineration emissions, landfilling) are included in the datasets. Iron materials (steel sheet, pipes, grey cast iron) already use a share of steel scrap at the production. These values are deducted from the recycled steel material before introduced to the melting to avoid a overvaluation of the credits. For the credits primary steel was used. Credits for the recycling of rare earth or mercury emissions from fluorescent lamps are not considered due to a lack of information.

Marble slab (thickness 0.02 m),Mineralische Baustoffe,Steine und Elemente,Naturwerkstein,DE,This data set has been modeled according to the European Standard EN 15804 for Sustainable Building. Results are depicted in modules that allow the structured expression of results over the entire life cycle.,No,en,"Marble ingots are obtained from quarries by blasting and sawing. After transport to the factory, the rough cut is done with a special saw, as well as the gate in plate blanks. These are further refined by grinding and polishing and then formatted. The life cycle assessment is dominated by the energy used for the individual processing steps as well as by the transport.  Background system: Electricity: Electricity from renewable and non- renewable powerplants is modelled so that it represents a countrys specific consumption mix including transmission / distribution losses, own consumption, imports, emissions and efficiency standards, and energy carrier properties. Several factors are taken into account. (1) Energy carrier production - The exploration, mining / production, processing, and transportation of energy carrier supply chains are modelled for each country. The models account for differences among countries in production and processing, including crude oil production technologies, flaring rates, production efficiencies, emissions, etc. (2) Energy carrier supply - Each countrys specific energy carrier supply is modelled, taking into account domestic supply versus imports from abroad. Energy carrier properties (e.g. carbon and energy content), which can vary depending from where an energy carrier is sourced, are adjusted accordingly. (3) Power plants - Models are created to represent energy carrier-specific power plants and electricity generation facilities specific to different renewable energy resources. Energy carrier production and supply models are used to represent power plant inputs. Combined heat and power (CHP) plants are also considered. (4) Electricity grid - Models representing the electricity generation facilities are combined into a larger model that reflects a countrys consumption mix. The larger model accounts for a countrys production mix, internal consumption (e.g. pumped storage for hydro power), transmission / distribution losses, and imported electricity. The country model is also adjusted according to national power plant emission and efficiency standards, as well as the countrys share of electricity plants versus CHP facilities. Thermal energy, process steam: The thermal energy and process steam supply is modelled to reflect each countrys emission standards and typical energy carriers (e.g., coal, natural gas, etc.) Both thermal energy and process steam are assumed to be produced at heat plants. Thermal energy datasets assume energy carrier inputs are converted to thermal energy with 100% efficiency; process steam datasets assume conversion efficiencies of 85%, 90% to 95%. The energy carriers used for the generation of thermal energy and process steam are modelled according to each countrys import situation (see electricity above). Transportation: All relevant and known transportation processes are included. Ocean-going and inland ship transport as well as rail, truck and pipeline transport of bulk commodities are considered. Energy carriers: The energy carriers and their respective properties are modelled according to the specific supply situation (see electricity above). Refinery products: Diesel fuel, gasoline, technical gases, fuel oils, lubricants and residues such as bitumen are modelled with a parameterised country-specific refinery model. The refinery model aims to represent each countrys refining processes (e.g. emissions levels, internal energy consumption, etc.), as well as the countrys product output spectrum, which can vary significantly among countries.

Photovoltaic system 1200 kWh/m²*a,Sonstige,Energieträger - Bereitstellung frei Verbraucher,Strom,DE,This data set has been modeled according to the European Standard EN 15804 for Sustainable Building. Results are depicted in modules that allow the structured expression of results over the entire life cycle.,No,en,"This dataset covers the life cycle of a phovoltaic system (PV module, cabling, fasteners and inverters), based on an area of 1 m². The photovoltaic model is based on the mix of different photovoltaic technologies installed:  Monocrystalline silicon cells 47.7%, polycrystalline silicon cells 38.3%, cadmium telluride (CdTe) 6.4%, amorphous silicon 5.1%, ribbon silicon 1.5% and copper-indium-gallium diselenide 1.0%. The following average efficiencies per technology are used: Mono-Silicon 14.0 %, Multi-Silicon 13.2%, Cadmium-Telluride (CdTe) 9.0%, Amorphous-Silicon 5.5 %, Ribbon-Silicon 11.2 %, Copper-Indium-Gallium-Diselenide 11.0 %. The weighted average efficiency is about 13.3%. The output of the plant is 165 kWp on a weighted average. The system efficiency of the system has been assumed to be 75%. Operational life times of the panels are modelled with 20 years. For the inverter, a lifetime of 10 years was assumed as a worst-case estimate. In the production and the end of life of this data set, 2 inverters have been incorporated. The degradation of the module efficiency of the PV modules was neglected. The data set includes the costs of production and an estimate of the loads and benefits at the end of life based on the division between the following materials and their subsequent treatment: - aluminum, steel, copper (material recycling) - plastic and printed circuit board (thermal utilization in MWI) - glass, PV cell (landfilling). Solar radiation energy was assumed to be 1200 kWh / m² * a, which corresponds to a favorable location in Germany (for rather unfavorable sites the dataset with 1000 kWh / m² * a should be used). This results in a production volume of 8698 MJ for 1 m² of photovoltaic installation over the lifetime of 20 years.  The savings by substitution are declared after deduction of the grid losses of 5% in the module D (the regeneratively produced electricity quantity replaces electricity from conventional production). Thus, module D is composed of the end of life of the materials and the substitution of conventional electricity generation, whereby the savings made by the substitution of the conventional electricity account for the main part of the resulting credits, while the proportion from the end of life of the materials is rather low.

Cofradal® 200 can be supplied without a concrete screed, which is then added at the building site. The underside is galvanised or precoated and has a flat, clean surface. These undersides are produced by primary steel route. The primary production pathway comprises multiple different process arrangements. The most common primary production pathway is the blast furnace-basic oxygen furnace (BF-BOF) route. Coke and iron ore (normally sinter produced from iron ore and limestone) are both fed into the blast furnace from the top; simultaneously, hot air and pulverised coal or natural gas (hydrogen is experimentally being used) are injected through pipes in the side of the lower part of the furnace called tuyeres. This results in a counter-cyclical process of descending iron ore met by rising reducing gases. Lime fluxes and other additives are also used in the blast furnace in varying quantities to control the level of impurities and the temperature. The blast furnace produces molten iron (“hot metal”) at temperatures up to 1400-1 500°C. The hot metal is then fed to the BOF, often in conjunction with some scrap, where oxygen is injected to lower the carbon content from approximately 4-5% to the required level of carbon for the steel grade produced. The produced liquid steel is then refined in a ladle furnace with addition of ferroalloys and metals to obtain the required steel characteristics. The steel is then casted at a continuous caster to obtain semi-finished products such as billets, blooms or slabs. These products are then rolled to the desired sizes and shapes. The following operations are two rolling processes: the hot strip mill and the cold rolling mill. In the hot rolling mill the slab is reshaped above the recrystallization temperature. The qualities obtained in this process are e.g. strength and surface quality. During the rolling process the material passes through the furnace and the rolling line. In the furnace the metal is preheated by natural gas. There is no need for an additional warming, if the hot slabs are directly charged into the rolling mill. The forming is done in various rolling frames until the final shape is obtained. The steel scrap in this process are directly recycled. In the cold rolling mill the material is reshaped below the recrystallization temperature. Thereby a enhanced surface quality, an improved dimensional accuracy as well as a higher strength are achieved. The different process steps are: pickling, the rolling line and the heat treatment. The rolled coil can be then metallic coated with various mixtures of metal coating such as Zn, Al, Mg and Si. After metallic coated, the coil can be further organic coated. In Contrisson (France) hot rolled steel coil is metallic coated and perfurated and then transported by truck to Montataire (France), where it is assembled and with rock wool, welded mesh and reinforcing bar.

Clay panel (thickness 0.02 m),Mineralische Baustoffe,Steine und Elemente,Lehmsteine,DE,This data set has been modeled according to the European Standard EN 15804 for Sustainable Building.

Reed mats are used for reinforcement and jute fabric (on the upper sides) is placed on both sides. After forming, a technical drying takes place (by using thermal energy from natural gas). This use of energy also dominates the LCA results. By taking into account the CO2 integration during the reed and jute growth, the CO2 balance is nevertheless comparatively small. It should be noted that at the end of the life cycle the incorporated CO2 is released again (for example after thermal treatment or rotting).  Background system: Electricity: Electricity from renewable and non- renewable powerplants is modelled so that it represents a countrys specific consumption mix including transmission / distribution losses, own consumption, imports, emissions and efficiency standards, and energy carrier properties. Several factors are taken into account. (1) Energy carrier production - The exploration, mining / production, processing, and transportation of energy carrier supply chains are modelled for each country. The models account for differences among countries in production and processing, including crude oil production technologies, flaring rates, production efficiencies, emissions, etc. (2) Energy carrier supply - Each countrys specific energy carrier supply is modelled, taking into account domestic supply versus imports from abroad. Energy carrier properties (e.g. carbon and energy content), which can vary depending from where an energy carrier is sourced, are adjusted accordingly. (3) Power plants - Models are created to represent energy carrier-specific power plants and electricity generation facilities specific to different renewable energy resources. Energy carrier production and supply models are used to represent power plant inputs. Combined heat and power (CHP) plants are also considered. (4) Electricity grid - Models representing the electricity generation facilities are combined into a larger model that reflects a countrys consumption mix. The larger model accounts for a countrys production mix, internal consumption (e.g. pumped storage for hydro power), transmission / distribution losses, and imported electricity. The country model is also adjusted according to national power plant emission and efficiency standards, as well as the countrys share of electricity plants versus CHP facilities. Thermal energy, process steam: The thermal energy and process steam supply is modelled to reflect each countrys emission standards and typical energy carriers (e.g., coal, natural gas, etc.) Both thermal energy and process steam are assumed to be produced at heat plants. Thermal energy datasets assume energy carrier inputs are converted to thermal energy with 100% efficiency; process steam datasets assume conversion efficiencies of 85%, 90% to 95%. The energy carriers used for the generation of thermal energy and process steam are modelled according to each countrys import situation (see electricity above). Transportation: All relevant and known transportation processes are included. Ocean-going and inland ship transport as well as rail, truck and pipeline transport of bulk commodities are considered. Energy carriers: The energy carriers and their respective properties are modelled according to the specific supply situation (see electricity above).

The system can consist of between two and five layers of ETFE foil (ethylene tetrafluoroethylene) depending on the building physics, static or design requirements and specifications. The g-values and U-values are determined by the number of layers and also the type of coating used. The ETFE foil thickness varies between 80 µm and 500 µm depending on the structural construction requirements.

The perfluorinated monomers such as TFE (Tetrafluoroethylene) is produced from R22 by pyrolysis process. The TFE monomer is distilled in order to obtain high purity for the polymerization process. Polymerization: The TFE monomer is polymerized in the autoclave together with ethylene and additives and the ETFE polymer is produced. The residual monomers are recovered and reused for the polymerization. Processing: The ETFE polymer is granulated and the ETFE beads are obtained. The beads are molten and pelletized with an extruder. The pellets are delivered to the customers and the film production process after quality check. Production of AGC Fluon® ETFE FILM: Fluon® ETFE FILM are manufactured by melt extrusion method. Fluon® ETFE resin is fed into the extruder from the hopper. The Fluon® ETFE resin is melted in the extruder and transferred to the die by the screw in the extruder. Melted resin is extruded through the die onto the cooling roll and is formed into the foil. The foil is carried on the rollers and the thickness or appearance of the foil are inspected by the inspection devices. After that, the edges of the foil are trimmed and finally the foil is rolled onto the core. Fabrication of the foil cushions: The foil rolls are produced in 1550 mm width and a length of between 100 to 500 metres, depending on the foil thickness. The rolls are cut in line with the project specifications. The individual cushion sections are cut to size on a plotter table, where also the position of other components like valves are drawn.

The life cycle assessment is mainly dominated by the required energy (sawing, grinding, etc.) and by the use of the binding agent.  Background system: Electricity: Electricity from renewable and non- renewable powerplants is modelled so that it represents a countrys specific consumption mix including transmission / distribution losses, own consumption, imports, emissions and efficiency standards, and energy carrier properties. Several factors are taken into account. (1) Energy carrier production - The exploration, mining / production, processing, and transportation of energy carrier supply chains are modelled for each country. The models account for differences among countries in production and processing, including crude oil production technologies, flaring rates, production efficiencies, emissions, etc. (2) Energy carrier supply - Each countrys specific energy carrier supply is modelled, taking into account domestic supply versus imports from abroad. Energy carrier properties (e.g. carbon and energy content), which can vary depending from where an energy carrier is sourced, are adjusted accordingly. (3) Power plants - Models are created to represent energy carrier-specific power plants and electricity generation facilities specific to different renewable energy resources. Energy carrier production and supply models are used to represent power plant inputs. Combined heat and power (CHP) plants are also considered. (4) Electricity grid - Models representing the electricity generation facilities are combined into a larger model that reflects a countrys consumption mix. The larger model accounts for a countrys production mix, internal consumption (e.g. pumped storage for hydro power), transmission / distribution losses, and imported electricity. The country model is also adjusted according to national power plant emission and efficiency standards, as well as the countrys share of electricity plants versus CHP facilities. Thermal energy, process steam: The thermal energy and process steam supply is modelled to reflect each countrys emission standards and typical energy carriers (e.g., coal, natural gas, etc.) Both thermal energy and process steam are assumed to be produced at heat plants. Thermal energy datasets assume energy carrier inputs are converted to thermal energy with 100% efficiency; process steam datasets assume conversion efficiencies of 85%, 90% to 95%.

Anodization of aluminium,Metalle,Oberflächenbehandlung und Beschichtung von Metallen,Anodisieren von Aluminium,DE,This data set has been modeled according to the European Standard EN 15804 for Sustainable Building. Results are depicted in modules that allow the structured expression of results over the entire life cycle.,No,en,"The dataset includes the process of anodizing of a 2 square meters aluminium profile. Not included is the production of the aluminium extrusion profile, which should be calculated separately. Anodizing is an electrolytic passivation process which increases the thickness of a natural oxide layer on surface of a metal part. The metal is cleaned with a cleaning agent and etched with sodium hydroxides or acids. To grow the aluminium, an electrolysis takes place. Direct current is passed through an electrolytic solution, the aluminium serves as an anode. The cathode consists of carbon, lead, nickel, stainless or other material which is unreactive during the electrolysis. The cathode produces hydrogen, the aluminium anode oxygen forming aluminium oxide. The electrolytic solution chosen depends on which kind of oxide layer has to be produced. Barrier oxide is grown in almost neutral solutions where aluminium oxide is hardly soluble, porous oxide in acidic solutions in which the oxide can also be dissolved. The most widely used solution is dilute sulphuric acid. Background system: Electricity: Electricity is modelled according to the individual country-specific situations. The country-specific modelling is achieved on multiple levels. Firstly, individual energy carrier specific power plants and plants for renewable energy sources are modelled according to the current national electricity grid mix. Modelling the electricity consumption mix includes transmission / distribution losses and the own use by energy producers (own consumption of power plants and ""other"" own consumption e.g. due to pumped storage hydro power etc.), as well as imported electricity. Secondly, the national emission and efficiency standards of the power plants are modelled as well as the share of electricity plants and combined heat and power plants (CHP). Thirdly, the country-specific energy carrier supply (share of imports and / or domestic supply) including the country-specific energy carrier properties (e.g. element and energy content) are accounted for. Fourthly, the exploration, mining/production, processing and transport processes of the energy carrier supply chains are modelled according to the specific situation of each electricity producing country. The different production and processing techniques (emissions and efficiencies) in the different energy producing countries are considered, e.g. different crude oil production technologies or different flaring rates at the oil platforms. Thermal energy, process steam: The thermal energy and process steam supply is modelled according to the individual country-specific situation with regard to emission standards and considered energy carriers. The thermal energy and process steam are produced at heat plants. Efficiencies for thermal energy production are by definition 100% in relation to the corresponding energy carrier input. For process steam the efficiency ranges from 85%, 90% to 95%. The energy carriers used for the generation of thermal energy and process steam are modelled according to the specific import situation (see electricity above). Transports: All relevant and known transport processes are included. Ocean-going and inland ship transport as well as rail, truck and pipeline transport of bulk commodities are considered. Energy carriers: The energy carriers are modelled according to the specific supply situation (see electricity above). Refinery products: Diesel fuel, gasoline, technical gases, fuel oils, lubricants and residues such as bitumen are modelled with a parameterised country-specific refinery model.

The installation distance is defined through the required heating capacity of the system. Simplified an installation distance of 100mm for sanitary areas and 200 mm for living and office areas is applied. The cross section for tubes wihich are used for underfloor heating systems is between 14 and 20 mm. For the data sets an average value of 17 mm has been used. According to VDI guideline 2067 for underfloor heating systems an average life span of 30 years can be assumed. It is expected, that the recycling quote of big appliances like boilers, air conditioning, and ventilation systems is 95%. For pipes or cables which are often flush-mounted a 90% recycling quote is expected. The quotes are only related to metals and plastics. For mineral materials like mineral wool, concrete or ceramics inert landfilling is assumed, as well as for 5-10% of metals and plastics (e.g. cable waste and pipe pieces) that are not recycled. Plastics that are not recycled are introduced to the municipal waste incineration. For the MWI a European model with average emission values and energy production rates was used. Depending on the incinerated type of plastic, different processes with corresponding elemental compositions were used. Then dataset were set up in collaboration with the Confederation of European Waste-to-Energy Plants (CEWEP) and are available on the website of the European Platform on LCA [EC 2008]. Power and thermal energy produced in the MWI are accounted to the European power- and thermal energy mix. The credits for the metal recycling and the energetic recovery of plastics, as well as the emission and resource consumptions (energy for remelting, incineration emissions, landfilling) are included in the datasets. Iron materials (steel sheet, pipes, grey cast iron) already use a share of steel scrap at the production. These values are deducted from the recycled steel material before introduced to the melting to avoid a overvaluation of the credits. For the credits primary steel was used. Credits for the recycling of rare earth or mercury emissions from fluorescent lamps are not considered due to a lack of information. The assumed transport distance from building to recycling plant/landfilling site or MWI are 50km using a truck. The assumed distance to the steel, copper, and aluminium plant is 200km by train.   Background system: Electricity: Electricity is modelled according to the individual country-specific situations. The country-specific modelling is achieved on multiple levels. Firstly, individual energy carrier specific power plants and plants for renewable energy sources are modelled according to the current national electricity grid mix. Modelling the electricity consumption mix includes transmission / distribution losses and the own use by energy producers (own consumption of power plants and ""other"" own consumption e.g. due to pumped storage hydro power etc.), as well as imported electricity. Secondly, the national emission and efficiency standards of the power plants are modelled as well as the share of electricity plants and combined heat and power plants (CHP). Thirdly, the country-specific energy carrier supply (share of imports and / or domestic supply) including the country-specific energy carrier properties (e.g. element and energy content) are accounted for. Fourthly, the exploration, mining/production, processing and transport processes of the energy carrier supply chains are modelled according to the specific situation of each electricity producing country. The different production and processing techniques (emissions and efficiencies) in the different energy producing countries are considered, e.g. different crude oil production technologies or different flaring rates at the oil platforms. Thermal energy, process steam: The thermal energy and process steam supply is modelled according to the individual country-specific situation with regard to emission standards and considered energy carriers. The thermal energy and process steam are produced at heat plants. Efficiencies for thermal energy production are by definition 100% in relation to the corresponding energy carrier input. For process steam the efficiency ranges from 85%, 90% to 95%. The energy carriers used for the generation of thermal energy and process steam are modelled according to the specific import situation (see electricity above). Transports: All relevant and known transport processes are included. Ocean-going and inland ship transport as well as rail, truck and pipeline transport of bulk commodities are considered. Energy carriers: The energy carriers are modelled according to the specific supply situation (see electricity above). Refinery products: Diesel fuel, gasoline, technical gases, fuel oils, lubricants and residues such as bitumen are modelled with a parameterised country-specific refinery model. The refinery model represents the current national standard in refining techniques (e.g. emission level, internal energy consumption, etc.) as well as the individual country-specific product output spectrum, which can be quite different from country to country.

Photovoltaic system 1000 kWh/m²*a,Sonstige,Energieträger - Bereitstellung frei Verbraucher,Strom,DE,This data set has been modeled according to the European Standard EN 15804+A2 for Sustainable Building. Results are depicted in modules that allow the structured expression of results over the entire life cycle.,No,en,"This dataset covers the life cycle of a phovoltaic system (PV module, cabling, fasteners and inverters), based on an area of 1 m². The photovoltaic model is based on the mix of different photovoltaic technologies installed:  Monocrystalline silicon cells 47.7%, polycrystalline silicon cells 38.3%, cadmium telluride (CdTe) 6.4%, amorphous silicon 5.1%, ribbon silicon 1.5% and copper-indium-gallium diselenide 1.0%. The following average efficiencies per technology are used: Mono-Silicon 14.0 %, Multi-Silicon 13.2%, Cadmium-Telluride (CdTe) 9.0%, Amorphous-Silicon 5.5 %, Ribbon-Silicon 11.2 %, Copper-Indium-Gallium-Diselenide 11.0 %. The weighted average efficiency is about 13.3%. The output of the plant is 165 kWp on a weighted average. The system efficiency of the system has been assumed to be 75%. Operational life times of the panels are modelled with 20 years. For the inverter, a lifetime of 10 years was assumed as a worst-case estimate. In the production and the end of life of this data set, 2 inverters have been incorporated. The degradation of the module efficiency of the PV modules was neglected. The data set includes the costs of production and an estimate of the loads and benefits at the end of life based on the division between the following materials and their subsequent treatment: - aluminum, steel, copper (material recycling) - plastic and printed circuit board (thermal utilization in MWI) - glass, PV cell (landfilling). Solar radiation energy was assumed to be 1000 kWh / m² * a, which corresponds to an unfavorable location in Germany (for rather favorable sites the dataset with 1200 kWh / m² * a should be used). This results in a production volume of 7249 MJ for 1 m² of photovoltaic installation over the lifetime of 20 years.  The savings by substitution are declared after deduction of the grid losses of 5% in the module D (the regeneratively produced electricity quantity replaces electricity from conventional production). Thus, module D is composed of the end of life of the materials and the substitution of conventional electricity generation, whereby the savings made by the substitution of the conventional electricity account for the main part of the resulting credits, while the proportion from the end of life of the materials is rather low.  Background system: Electricity: Electricity is modelled according to the individual country-specific situations. The country-specific modelling is achieved on multiple levels. Firstly, individual energy carrier specific power plants and plants for renewable energy sources are modelled according to the current national electricity grid mix. Modelling the electricity consumption mix includes transmission / distribution losses and the own use by energy producers (own consumption of power plants and ""other"" own consumption e.g. due to pumped storage hydro power etc.), as well as imported electricity. Secondly, the national emission and efficiency standards of the power plants are modelled as well as the share of electricity plants and combined heat and power plants (CHP). Thirdly, the country-specific energy carrier supply (share of imports and / or domestic supply) including the country-specific energy carrier properties (e.g. element and energy content) are accounted for. Fourthly, the exploration, mining/production, processing and transport processes of the energy carrier supply chains are modelled according to the specific situation of each electricity producing country. The different production and processing techniques (emissions and efficiencies) in the different energy producing countries are considered, e.g. different crude oil production technologies or different flaring rates at the oil platforms. Thermal energy, process steam: The thermal energy and process steam supply is modelled according to the individual country-specific situation with regard to emission standards and considered energy carriers. The thermal energy and process steam are produced at heat plants. Efficiencies for thermal energy production are by definition 100% in relation to the corresponding energy carrier input. For process steam the efficiency ranges from 85%, 90% to 95%. The energy carriers used for the generation of thermal energy and process steam are modelled according to the specific import situation (see electricity above). Transports: All relevant and known transport processes are included. Ocean-going and inland ship transport as well as rail, truck and pipeline transport of bulk commodities are considered. Energy carriers: The energy carriers are modelled according to the specific supply situation (see electricity above). Refinery products: Diesel fuel, gasoline, technical gases, fuel oils, lubricants and residues such as bitumen are modelled with a parameterised country-specific refinery model. The refinery model represents the current national standard in refining techniques (e.g. emission level, internal energy consumption, etc.) as well as the individual country-specific product output spectrum, which can be quite different from country to country.

The LCI dataset consider the production and assembly of the of the aluminium parts, the side materials (screw, sealing materials), as well as the 3 pane glass. Transportation processes for the raw materials are accounted for as far as data on average transport distances were available. All relevant energy and energy flow are included in the system. Life cycle impacts of production equipment and infrastructure were not included in the system as no evidence could be justified that these are to any extent relevant and thus fell under the cut-off criteria. In mass production the impact of production equipment and infrastructure normally is in orders of magnitude lower than the impacts of material and energy supply.  In module C1, a manual dismantling (no loads) is assumed, collecting losses are neglected. The transport in module C2 to the recycling plant takes place with a truck (50km).  Tratment of metal components: Collecting losses are neglected. It is assumed that all metals reach the end of the waste status immediately after dismantling. This means that the loads for processing and the credits for the substitution of primary material are shown in Module D. Module D includes loads for sorting, remelting, slag treatment, landfill, filtration of dusts and dross treatment.

Underfloor heating system PEX (100mm distance),Gebäudetechnik,Heizung,Wärmeverteilung und Abgabe,DE,This data set has been modeled according to the European Standard EN 15804+A2 for Sustainable Building. Results are depicted in modules that allow the structured expression of results over the entire life cycle.,No,en,"Underfloor heating system consisting of pipelines with an installation distance of a 100 mm and 30 mm insulation panel of expanded polystyrene on which the pipelines of PEX tubes are fixed with clips. The installation distance is defined through the required heating capacity of the system. Simplified an installation distance of 100mm for sanitary areas and 200 mm for living and office areas is applied. The cross section for tubes wihich are used for underfloor heating systems is between 14 and 20 mm. For the data sets an average value of 17 mm has been used. According to VDI guideline 2067 for underfloor heating systems an average life span of 30 years can be assumed.  It is expected, that the recycling quote of big appliances like boilers, air conditioning, and ventilation systems is 95%. For pipes or cables which are often flush-mounted a 90% recycling quote is expected. The quotes are only related to metals and plastics. For mineral materials like mineral wool, concrete or ceramics inert landfilling is assumed, as well as for 5-10% of metals and plastics (e.g. cable waste and pipe pieces) that are not recycled. Plastics that are not recycled are introduced to the municipal waste incineration. For the MWI a European model with average emission values and energy production rates was used. Depending on the incinerated type of plastic, different processes with corresponding elemental compositions were used. Then dataset were set up in collaboration with the Confederation of European Waste-to-Energy Plants (CEWEP) and are available on the website of the European Platform on LCA [EC 2008]. Power and thermal energy produced in the MWI are accounted to the European power- and thermal energy mix. The credits for the metal recycling and the energetic recovery of plastics, as well as the emission and resource consumptions (energy for remelting, incineration emissions, landfilling) are included in the datasets. Iron materials (steel sheet, pipes, grey cast iron) already use a share of steel scrap at the production. These values are deducted from the recycled steel material before introduced to the melting to avoid a overvaluation of the credits. For the credits primary steel was used. Credits for the recycling of rare earth or mercury emissions from fluorescent lamps are not considered due to a lack of information. The assumed transport distance from building to recycling plant/landfilling site or MWI are 50km using a truck. The assumed distance to the steel, copper, and aluminium plant is 200km by train.   Background system: Electricity: Electricity is modelled according to the individual country-specific situations. The country-specific modelling is achieved on multiple levels. Firstly, individual energy carrier specific power plants and plants for renewable energy sources are modelled according to the current national electricity grid mix. Modelling the electricity consumption mix includes transmission / distribution losses and the own use by energy producers (own consumption of power plants and ""other"" own consumption e.g. due to pumped storage hydro power etc.), as well as imported electricity. Secondly, the national emission and efficiency standards of the power plants are modelled as well as the share of electricity plants and combined heat and power plants (CHP). Thirdly, the country-specific energy carrier supply (share of imports and / or domestic supply) including the country-specific energy carrier properties (e.g. element and energy content) are accounted for. Fourthly, the exploration, mining/production, processing and transport processes of the energy carrier supply chains are modelled according to the specific situation of each electricity producing country. The different production and processing techniques (emissions and efficiencies) in the different energy producing countries are considered, e.g. different crude oil production technologies or different flaring rates at the oil platforms. Thermal energy, process steam: The thermal energy and process steam supply is modelled according to the individual country-specific situation with regard to emission standards and considered energy carriers. The thermal energy and process steam are produced at heat plants. Efficiencies for thermal energy production are by definition 100% in relation to the corresponding energy carrier input. For process steam the efficiency ranges from 85%, 90% to 95%. The energy carriers used for the generation of thermal energy and process steam are modelled according to the specific import situation (see electricity above). Transports: All relevant and known transport processes are included. Ocean-going and inland ship transport as well as rail, truck and pipeline transport of bulk commodities are considered. Energy carriers: The energy carriers are modelled according to the specific supply situation (see electricity above). Refinery products: Diesel fuel, gasoline, technical gases, fuel oils, lubricants and residues such as bitumen are modelled with a parameterised country-specific refinery model. The refinery model represents the current national standard in refining techniques (e.g. emission level, internal energy consumption, etc.) as well as the individual country-specific product output spectrum, which can be quite different from country to country.

Hot dip galvanized steel sheet,Metalle,Stahl und Eisen,Stahlbleche,DE,This data set has been modeled according to the European Standard EN 15804+A2 for Sustainable Building. Results are depicted in modules that allow the structured expression of results over the entire life cycle.,No,en,"The data set represents the steel production in Germany based on the main production steps which take place within an integrated steel plant. These production steps as well as the main upstream process steps are described in the following.  The main primary products are iron ore, pellets and hard coal. The import mix for the German steel production concerning iron ore and pellets is: Canada 50%, Brazil 25%, Australia 25%. The import mix for the German steel production concerning hard coal is: 100% Canada. The iron ore mining is explained in detail in the respective documentation file (please see link below). The preparation of the iron ore includes mainly the crushing. The average iron content in the iron ore is 60%. Pellets are small crystallized balls of iron ore. The pelletisation process consists of grinding and drying, balling and induration followed by screening and handling. The provision of hard coal is described in the respective documentation file (please see link below).  For every fraction the transport to Germany is considered in the data set. The transportation includes all necessary transportation means like ship and where required railway.  The coke oven produces as main product coke out of hard coal. The main by-product resulting from this operation is coke oven gas (COG gas) which is used as energy carrier within the steel production. Further by-products as tar, benzene and sulphur are sold and therefore excluded from the system by allocation to (net) calorific value.  In the sinter plant sinter feed is produced based on the major inputs coke, iron ore and additives. Sintering is an agglomeration process which takes place under high temperatures. The raw materials (fine iron ore, coke breeze, additives) are blended, then the coke breeze is ignited. The result of the sinter process is the so-called sinter cake which has to be broken up, screened and cooled down.  The blast furnace is a closed system into which iron bearing materials (iron ore lump, sinter and / or pellets), additives (slag formers such as limestone) and reducing agents (coke) are continuously fed from the top of the furnace shaft through a charging system. A hot air blast, enriched with oxygen and auxiliary reducing agents (e.g. pulverized coal) is injected providing a counter-current of reducing gases. The air blast reacts with the reducing agents to produce mainly carbon monoxide which in turn reduces iron oxides to metal iron. The main products of the blast furnace operation are hot metal, blast furnace gas (BF gas) and blast furnace slag (BF slag). The BF gas is used as fuel for heating comparable to the COG gas or for electricity production.  The objective in oxygen steelmaking is to burn (i.e., oxidise) the undesirable impurities contained in the metallic feedstock. The main elements thus converted into oxides are carbon, silicon, manganese, phosphorus and sulphur. The purpose of this oxidation process, therefore, are to reduce the carbon content to a specified level to adjust the contents of desirable foreign elements and to remove undesirable impurities to the greatest possible extent. The production of steel by the basic oxygen furnace (BOF) process is a discontinuous process which involves the following steps: transfer and storage of hot metal, pre-treatment of hot metal (desulphurisation), oxidation in the BOF (decarburisation and oxidation of impurities) and secondary metallurgical treatment (e.g. vacuum treatment and adding alloying elements). Within the main step of the oxygen steelmaking, the hot metal feeds together with steel scrap the converter. The main products of the converter are the liquid steel, the converter gas or basic oxygen furnace gas (BOF gas) and the BOF slag. The gas is as well used as energy carrier within the steel production.  Afterwards the continuous casting takes place whereby the liquid steel is cast in continuous strand. The output of the continuous casting process is the slab.  The following operations are two rolling processes: the hot strip mill and the cold rolling mill. In the hot rolling mill the slab is reshaped above the recrystallization temperature. The qualities obtained in this process are e.g. strength and surface quality. During the rolling process the material passes through the furnace and the rolling line. In the furnace the metal is preheated by natural gas. There is no need for an additional warming, if the hot slabs are directly charged into the rolling mill. The forming is done in various rolling frames until the final shape is obtained. The steel scrap in this process are directly recycled.  In the cold rolling mill the material is reshaped below the recrystallization temperature. Thereby a enhanced surface quality, an improved dimensional accuracy as well as a higher strength are achieved. The different process steps are: pickling, the rolling line and the heat treatment.  The cold rolled sheet is transferred to the hot-dip galvanising. The zinc coating is applied by dipping the sheet steel into a hot zinc bath. During the hot-dip galvanising the cold rolled sheet passes the following process steps: preheating furnace (organic impurities are burned off), reduction zone (the sheet is heated to cause recrystallization), cooling and homogenization as well as metal bath (coating of the sheet)  and finishing stand.     In the disposal phase, mechanical dismantling is accounted for in module C1 for steel products (excavator), for all other metals a manual dismantling is assumed (no loads). Collecting losses are neglected. It is assumed that all metals reach the end of the waste status immediately after dismantling. This means that the loads for processing and the credits for the substitution of primary material are shown in Module D. The transport in module C2 to the treatment plant takes place with a truck (50km). Module D includes loads for sorting, remelting, slag treatment, landfill, filtration of dusts and dross treatment.

Copper pipes within the glass tubes are used as an absorber. They have narrow absorber surfaces at the side in addition. Underneath the glass tubes a reflector of aluminium plate is fixed to increas the energy yield. According to VDI Richtlinie 2067 an average lifetime of 20 years of the solar collector can be assumed. It is expected, that the recycling quote of big appliances like boilers, air conditioning, and ventilation systems is 95%. For pipes or cables which are often flush-mounted a 90% recycling quote is expected. The quotes are only related to metals and plastics. For mineral materials like mineral wool, concrete or ceramics inert landfilling is assumed, as well as for 5-10% of metals and plastics (e.g. cable waste and pipe pieces) that are not recycled. Plastics that are not recycled are introduced to the municipal waste incineration. For the MWI a European model with average emission values and energy production rates was used. Depending on the incinerated type of plastic, different processes with corresponding elemental compositions were used. Then dataset were set up in collaboration with the Confederation of European Waste-to-Energy Plants (CEWEP) and are available on the website of the European Platform on LCA [EC 2008]. Power and thermal energy produced in the MWI are accounted to the European power- and thermal energy mix. The credits for the metal recycling and the energetic recovery of plastics, as well as the emission and resource consumptions (energy for remelting, incineration emissions, landfilling) are included in the datasets. Iron materials (steel sheet, pipes, grey cast iron) already use a share of steel scrap at the production. These values are deducted from the recycled steel material before introduced to the melting to avoid a overvaluation of the credits. For the credits primary steel was used. Credits for the recycling of rare earth or mercury emissions from fluorescent lamps are not considered due to a lack of information. The assumed transport distance from building to recycling plant/landfilling site or MWI are 50km using a truck. The assumed distance to the steel, copper, and aluminium plant is 200km by train.   Background system: Electricity: Electricity is modelled according to the individual country-specific situations. The country-specific modelling is achieved on multiple levels. Firstly, individual energy carrier specific power plants and plants for renewable energy sources are modelled according to the current national electricity grid mix. Modelling the electricity consumption mix includes transmission / distribution losses and the own use by energy producers (own consumption of power plants and ""other"" own consumption e.g. due to pumped storage hydro power etc.), as well as imported electricity. Secondly, the national emission and efficiency standards of the power plants are modelled as well as the share of electricity plants and combined heat and power plants (CHP). Thirdly, the country-specific energy carrier supply (share of imports and / or domestic supply) including the country-specific energy carrier properties (e.g. element and energy content) are accounted for. Fourthly, the exploration, mining/production, processing and transport processes of the energy carrier supply chains are modelled according to the specific situation of each electricity producing country. The different production and processing techniques (emissions and efficiencies) in the different energy producing countries are considered, e.g. different crude oil production technologies or different flaring rates at the oil platforms. Thermal energy, process steam: The thermal energy and process steam supply is modelled according to the individual country-specific situation with regard to emission standards and considered energy carriers. The thermal energy and process steam are produced at heat plants. Efficiencies for thermal energy production are by definition 100% in relation to the corresponding energy carrier input. For process steam the efficiency ranges from 85%, 90% to 95%. The energy carriers used for the generation of thermal energy and process steam are modelled according to the specific import situation (see electricity above). Transports: All relevant and known transport processes are included. Ocean-going and inland ship transport as well as rail, truck and pipeline transport of bulk commodities are considered. Energy carriers: The energy carriers are modelled according to the specific supply situation (see electricity above). Refinery products: Diesel fuel, gasoline, technical gases, fuel oils, lubricants and residues such as bitumen are modelled with a parameterised country-specific refinery model.

Not included is the production of the metal substrate, which shall be calculated separately. Top coat application: The dataset describes the use of a solvent-based white industrial coating with 35% of organic solvents and 65% solids. The top coat is applicated in a climated spraybooth. The climatisation uses thermal enrgy from natural gas and desalinated water in order to keep the temperature and humidity of the process air in a narrow application window and possibly unaffected from outside weather changes for quality reasons. The amount of energy and water needed for this are strongly dependent on local climate conditions, the data used here is representative for northern Germany inland. The process air contains coating particles (the transfer losses) and therefore needs to be cleaned, which is usually done in a waterwash type filter. For this, coagulation chemicals are needed and evaporated water needs to be replaced by tap water. Waste (coagulated coating sludge) is incinerated in a waste incineration plant because of its energy content. Credits are given for the electricity and steam that are produced there. Rinsing agents are used to clean the coating application system when colours are changed. No waste water is generated, the process is usually run in an effluent free operation mode.

Flat solar collector,Gebäudetechnik,Heizung,Wärmeerzeuger,DE,This data set has been modeled according to the European Standard EN 15804+A2 for Sustainable Building. Results are depicted in modules that allow the structured expression of results over the entire life cycle.,No,en,"The dataset represents an solar collector with a flat glass cover and an underlying absorber of copper. According to VDI Richtlinie 2067 an average lifetime of 20 years of the solar collector can be assumed. It is expected, that the recycling quote of big appliances like boilers, air conditioning, and ventilation systems is 95%. For pipes or cables which are often flush-mounted a 90% recycling quote is expected. The quotes are only related to metals and plastics. For mineral materials like mineral wool, concrete or ceramics inert landfilling is assumed, as well as for 5-10% of metals and plastics (e.g. cable waste and pipe pieces) that are not recycled. Plastics that are not recycled are introduced to the municipal waste incineration. For the MWI a European model with average emission values and energy production rates was used. Depending on the incinerated type of plastic, different processes with corresponding elemental compositions were used. Then dataset were set up in collaboration with the Confederation of European Waste-to-Energy Plants (CEWEP) and are available on the website of the European Platform on LCA [EC 2008]. Power and thermal energy produced in the MWI are accounted to the European power- and thermal energy mix. The credits for the metal recycling and the energetic recovery of plastics, as well as the emission and resource consumptions (energy for remelting, incineration emissions, landfilling) are included in the datasets. Iron materials (steel sheet, pipes, grey cast iron) already use a share of steel scrap at the production. These values are deducted from the recycled steel material before introduced to the melting to avoid a overvaluation of the credits. For the credits primary steel was used. Credits for the recycling of rare earth or mercury emissions from fluorescent lamps are not considered due to a lack of information. The assumed transport distance from building to recycling plant/landfilling site or MWI are 50km using a truck. The assumed distance to the steel, copper, and aluminium plant is 200km by train.   Background system: Electricity: Electricity is modelled according to the individual country-specific situations. The country-specific modelling is achieved on multiple levels. Firstly, individual energy carrier specific power plants and plants for renewable energy sources are modelled according to the current national electricity grid mix. Modelling the electricity consumption mix includes transmission / distribution losses and the own use by energy producers (own consumption of power plants and ""other"" own consumption e.g. due to pumped storage hydro power etc.), as well as imported electricity. Secondly, the national emission and efficiency standards of the power plants are modelled as well as the share of electricity plants and combined heat and power plants (CHP). Thirdly, the country-specific energy carrier supply (share of imports and / or domestic supply) including the country-specific energy carrier properties (e.g. element and energy content) are accounted for. Fourthly, the exploration, mining/production, processing and transport processes of the energy carrier supply chains are modelled according to the specific situation of each electricity producing country. The different production and processing techniques (emissions and efficiencies) in the different energy producing countries are considered, e.g. different crude oil production technologies or different flaring rates at the oil platforms. Thermal energy, process steam: The thermal energy and process steam supply is modelled according to the individual country-specific situation with regard to emission standards and considered energy carriers. The thermal energy and process steam are produced at heat plants. Efficiencies for thermal energy production are by definition 100% in relation to the corresponding energy carrier input. For process steam the efficiency ranges from 85%, 90% to 95%. The energy carriers used for the generation of thermal energy and process steam are modelled according to the specific import situation (see electricity above). Transports: All relevant and known transport processes are included. Ocean-going and inland ship transport as well as rail, truck and pipeline transport of bulk commodities are considered. Energy carriers: The energy carriers are modelled according to the specific supply situation (see electricity above). Refinery products: Diesel fuel, gasoline, technical gases, fuel oils, lubricants and residues such as bitumen are modelled with a parameterised country-specific refinery model. The refinery model represents the current national standard in refining techniques (e.g. emission level, internal energy consumption, etc.) as well as the individual country-specific product output spectrum, which can be quite different from country to country.

Underfloor heating system copper (100mm distance),Gebäudetechnik,Heizung,Wärmeverteilung und Abgabe,DE,This data set has been modeled according to the European Standard EN 15804+A2 for Sustainable Building. Results are depicted in modules that allow the structured expression of results over the entire life cycle.,No,en,"Underfloor heating system consisting of pipelines with an installation distance of a 100 mm and 30 mm insulation panel of expanded polystyrene on which the pipelines of copper tubes are fixed with clips. The installation distance is defined through the required heating capacity of the system. Simplified an installation distance of 100 mm for sanitary areas and 200 mm for living and office areas is applied. The cross section for tubes wihich are used for underfloor heating systems is between 14 and 20 mm. For the data sets an average value of 17 mm has been used. According to VDI guideline 2067 for underfloor heating systems an average life span of 30 years can be assumed. It is expected, that the recycling quote of big appliances like boilers, air conditioning, and ventilation systems is 95%. For pipes or cables which are often flush-mounted a 90% recycling quote is expected. The quotes are only related to metals and plastics. For mineral materials like mineral wool, concrete or ceramics inert landfilling is assumed, as well as for 5-10% of metals and plastics (e.g. cable waste and pipe pieces) that are not recycled. Plastics that are not recycled are introduced to the municipal waste incineration. For the MWI a European model with average emission values and energy production rates was used. Depending on the incinerated type of plastic, different processes with corresponding elemental compositions were used. Then dataset were set up in collaboration with the Confederation of European Waste-to-Energy Plants (CEWEP) and are available on the website of the European Platform on LCA [EC 2008]. Power and thermal energy produced in the MWI are accounted to the European power- and thermal energy mix. The credits for the metal recycling and the energetic recovery of plastics, as well as the emission and resource consumptions (energy for remelting, incineration emissions, landfilling) are included in the datasets. Iron materials (steel sheet, pipes, grey cast iron) already use a share of steel scrap at the production. These values are deducted from the recycled steel material before introduced to the melting to avoid a overvaluation of the credits. For the credits primary steel was used. Credits for the recycling of rare earth or mercury emissions from fluorescent lamps are not considered due to a lack of information. The assumed transport distance from building to recycling plant/landfilling site or MWI are 50km using a truck. The assumed distance to the steel, copper, and aluminium plant is 200km by train.   Background system: Electricity: Electricity is modelled according to the individual country-specific situations. The country-specific modelling is achieved on multiple levels. Firstly, individual energy carrier specific power plants and plants for renewable energy sources are modelled according to the current national electricity grid mix. Modelling the electricity consumption mix includes transmission / distribution losses and the own use by energy producers (own consumption of power plants and ""other"" own consumption e.g. due to pumped storage hydro power etc.), as well as imported electricity. Secondly, the national emission and efficiency standards of the power plants are modelled as well as the share of electricity plants and combined heat and power plants (CHP). Thirdly, the country-specific energy carrier supply (share of imports and / or domestic supply) including the country-specific energy carrier properties (e.g. element and energy content) are accounted for. Fourthly, the exploration, mining/production, processing and transport processes of the energy carrier supply chains are modelled according to the specific situation of each electricity producing country. The different production and processing techniques (emissions and efficiencies) in the different energy producing countries are considered, e.g. different crude oil production technologies or different flaring rates at the oil platforms. Thermal energy, process steam: The thermal energy and process steam supply is modelled according to the individual country-specific situation with regard to emission standards and considered energy carriers. The thermal energy and process steam are produced at heat plants. Efficiencies for thermal energy production are by definition 100% in relation to the corresponding energy carrier input. For process steam the efficiency ranges from 85%, 90% to 95%. The energy carriers used for the generation of thermal energy and process steam are modelled according to the specific import situation (see electricity above). Transports: All relevant and known transport processes are included. Ocean-going and inland ship transport as well as rail, truck and pipeline transport of bulk commodities are considered. Energy carriers: The energy carriers are modelled according to the specific supply situation (see electricity above). Refinery products: Diesel fuel, gasoline, technical gases, fuel oils, lubricants and residues such as bitumen are modelled with a parameterised country-specific refinery model. The refinery model represents the current national standard in refining techniques (e.g. emission level, internal energy consumption, etc.) as well as the individual country-specific product output spectrum, which can be quite different from country to country. The supply of crude oil is modelled, again, according to the country-specific situation with the respective properties of the resources.",en,This product can be used in construction.,en,generic dataset,1.0,1.0,Square meter,Sphera Solutions GmbH,f55e9321-9133-4259-8abe-fe9cd8ae9171_20.21.060.xml,"{'A1-A3': 22.6001464512013, 'C2': 0.0521966281342491, 'C3': 3.16419615484842, 'C4': 0.0101305885608656, 'D': -5.26012525070412}",22.6001464512013,22.600147

The required composition of raw materials, including also recycled wastes, is mixed and grinded in mills, either in a wet or a dry process. In the wet process, the slurry produced (with around 25-30 % water) is treated in spray driers that use thermal energy from natural gas and high air pressure in order to produce a dry powder with spherical granules of appropriate size distribution, ready to be pressed. In the drying process the production of energy via cogeneration is a widespread practice. In the dry process, without water, no spray driers are used. Ceramic tiles are generally formed by dry pressing, using special moulds (isostatic pressing). At present new forming techniques have been developed in particular for thin and large size tiles, using special tape compaction procedures. The required formats are obtained by cutting the initial slabs after compaction. Glazing and decoration are performed on dried tile surfaces. Both wet and dry application techniques can be used. Digital glazing and decoration techniques have been introduced and adopted in the ceramic tile industry, and are at the base of very special ceramic tile surfaces. The firing phase takes place at different temperatures (depending on the ceramic tile produced, between 1000° C and 1300° C ) in order to achieve the typical ceramic tile features of abrasion, water and chemicals resistance and durability. Before selection and packing lines, rectified products are cut and squared at the desired size. The final product is packed in cardboard boxes, stacked on wooden pallets and protected with PET film. The tiles are stored in a warehouse until the order preparation for customer shipment.

The cross section for tubes wihich are used for underfloor heating systems is between 14 and 20 mm. For the data sets an average value of 17 mm has been used. According to VDI guideline 2067 for underfloor heating systems an average life span of 30 years can be assumed. It is expected, that the recycling quote of big appliances like boilers, air conditioning, and ventilation systems is 95%. For pipes or cables which are often flush-mounted a 90% recycling quote is expected. The quotes are only related to metals and plastics. For mineral materials like mineral wool, concrete or ceramics inert landfilling is assumed, as well as for 5-10% of metals and plastics (e.g. cable waste and pipe pieces) that are not recycled.

Background system: Electricity: Electricity is modelled according to the individual country-specific situations. The country-specific modelling is achieved on multiple levels. Firstly, individual energy carrier specific power plants and plants for renewable energy sources are modelled according to the current national electricity grid mix. Modelling the electricity consumption mix includes transmission / distribution losses and the own use by energy producers (own consumption of power plants and ""other"" own consumption e.g. due to pumped storage hydro power etc.), as well as imported electricity.

Results are depicted in modules that allow the structured expression of results over the entire life cycle.,No,en,"This dataset covers the life cycle of a phovoltaic system (PV module, cabling, fasteners and inverters), based on an area of 1 m². The photovoltaic model is based on the mix of different photovoltaic technologies installed:  Monocrystalline silicon cells 47.7%, polycrystalline silicon cells 38.3%, cadmium telluride (CdTe) 6.4%, amorphous silicon 5.1%, ribbon silicon 1.5% and copper-indium-gallium diselenide 1.0%. The following average efficiencies per technology are used: Mono-Silicon 14.0 %, Multi-Silicon 13.2%, Cadmium-Telluride (CdTe) 9.0%, Amorphous-Silicon 5.5 %, Ribbon-Silicon 11.2 %, Copper-Indium-Gallium-Diselenide 11.0 %. The weighted average efficiency is about 13.3%. The output of the plant is 165 kWp on a weighted average. The system efficiency of the system has been assumed to be 75%. Operational life times of the panels are modelled with 20 years. For the inverter, a lifetime of 10 years was assumed as a worst-case estimate. In the production and the end of life of this data set, 2 inverters have been incorporated. The degradation of the module efficiency of the PV modules was neglected. The data set includes the costs of production and an estimate of the loads and benefits at the end of life based on the division between the following materials and their subsequent treatment: - aluminum, steel, copper (material recycling) - plastic and printed circuit board (thermal utilization in MWI) - glass, PV cell (landfilling). Solar radiation energy was assumed to be 1000 kWh / m² * a, which corresponds to an unfavorable location in Germany (for rather favorable sites the dataset with 1200 kWh / m² * a should be used).

Background system: Electricity: Electricity is modelled according to the individual country-specific situations. The country-specific modelling is achieved on multiple levels. Firstly, individual energy carrier specific power plants and plants for renewable energy sources are modelled according to the current national electricity grid mix. Modelling the electricity consumption mix includes transmission / distribution losses and the own use by energy producers (own consumption of power plants and ""other"" own consumption e.g. due to pumped storage hydro power etc.), as well as imported electricity. Secondly, the national emission and efficiency standards of the power plants are modelled as well as the share of electricity plants and combined heat and power plants (CHP). Thirdly, the country-specific energy carrier supply (share of imports and / or domestic supply) including the country-specific energy carrier properties (e.g. element and energy content) are accounted for. Fourthly, the exploration, mining/production, processing and transport processes of the energy carrier supply chains are modelled according to the specific situation of each electricity producing country. The different production and processing techniques (emissions and efficiencies) in the different energy producing countries are considered, e.g. different crude oil production technologies or different flaring rates at the oil platforms. Thermal energy, process steam: The thermal energy and process steam supply is modelled according to the individual country-specific situation with regard to emission standards and considered energy carriers.

The cross section for tubes wihich are used for underfloor heating systems is between 14 and 20 mm. For the data sets an average value of 17 mm has been used. According to VDI guideline 2067 for underfloor heating systems an average life span of 30 years can be assumed. It is expected, that the recycling quote of big appliances like boilers, air conditioning, and ventilation systems is 95%. For pipes or cables which are often flush-mounted a 90% recycling quote is expected. The quotes are only related to metals and plastics. For mineral materials like mineral wool, concrete or ceramics inert landfilling is assumed, as well as for 5-10% of metals and plastics (e.g. cable waste and pipe pieces) that are not recycled. Plastics that are not recycled are introduced to the municipal waste incineration. For the MWI a European model with average emission values and energy production rates was used. Depending on the incinerated type of plastic, different processes with corresponding elemental compositions were used. Then dataset were set up in collaboration with the Confederation of European Waste-to-Energy Plants (CEWEP) and are available on the website of the European Platform on LCA [EC 2008].

Photovoltaic system 1200 kWh/m²*a (no electricity credits),Sonstige,Energieträger - Bereitstellung frei Verbraucher,Strom,DE,This data set has been modeled according to the European Standard EN 15804+A2 for Sustainable Building. Results are depicted in modules that allow the structured expression of results over the entire life cycle.,No,en,"This dataset covers the life cycle of a phovoltaic system (PV module, cabling, fasteners and inverters), based on an area of 1 m². The photovoltaic model is based on the mix of different photovoltaic technologies installed:  Monocrystalline silicon cells 47.7%, polycrystalline silicon cells 38.3%, cadmium telluride (CdTe) 6.4%, amorphous silicon 5.1%, ribbon silicon 1.5% and copper-indium-gallium diselenide 1.0%. The following average efficiencies per technology are used: Mono-Silicon 14.0 %, Multi-Silicon 13.2%, Cadmium-Telluride (CdTe) 9.0%, Amorphous-Silicon 5.5 %, Ribbon-Silicon 11.2 %, Copper-Indium-Gallium-Diselenide 11.0 %. The weighted average efficiency is about 13.3%. The output of the plant is 165 kWp on a weighted average. The system efficiency of the system has been assumed to be 75%. Operational life times of the panels are modelled with 20 years. For the inverter, a lifetime of 10 years was assumed as a worst-case estimate. In the production and the end of life of this data set, 2 inverters have been incorporated. The degradation of the module efficiency of the PV modules was neglected. The data set includes the costs of production and an estimate of the loads and benefits at the end of life based on the division between the following materials and their subsequent treatment: - aluminum, steel, copper (material recycling) - plastic and printed circuit board (thermal utilization in MWI) - glass, PV cell (landfilling). Solar radiation energy was assumed to be 1200 kWh / m² * a, which corresponds to a favorable location in Germany (for rather unfavorable sites the dataset with 1000 kWh / m² * a should be used). This results in a production volume of 8698 MJ for 1 m² of photovoltaic installation over the lifetime of 20 years.  In this dataset, module D is composed of the end of life of the materials only.  Background system: Electricity: Electricity is modelled according to the individual country-specific situations. The country-specific modelling is achieved on multiple levels. Firstly, individual energy carrier specific power plants and plants for renewable energy sources are modelled according to the current national electricity grid mix. Modelling the electricity consumption mix includes transmission / distribution losses and the own use by energy producers (own consumption of power plants and ""other"" own consumption e.g. due to pumped storage hydro power etc.), as well as imported electricity. Secondly, the national emission and efficiency standards of the power plants are modelled as well as the share of electricity plants and combined heat and power plants (CHP). Thirdly, the country-specific energy carrier supply (share of imports and / or domestic supply) including the country-specific energy carrier properties (e.g. element and energy content) are accounted for. Fourthly, the exploration, mining/production, processing and transport processes of the energy carrier supply chains are modelled according to the specific situation of each electricity producing country. The different production and processing techniques (emissions and efficiencies) in the different energy producing countries are considered, e.g. different crude oil production technologies or different flaring rates at the oil platforms. Thermal energy, process steam: The thermal energy and process steam supply is modelled according to the individual country-specific situation with regard to emission standards and considered energy carriers. The thermal energy and process steam are produced at heat plants. Efficiencies for thermal energy production are by definition 100% in relation to the corresponding energy carrier input. For process steam the efficiency ranges from 85%, 90% to 95%. The energy carriers used for the generation of thermal energy and process steam are modelled according to the specific import situation (see electricity above). Transports: All relevant and known transport processes are included. Ocean-going and inland ship transport as well as rail, truck and pipeline transport of bulk commodities are considered. Energy carriers: The energy carriers are modelled according to the specific supply situation (see electricity above). Refinery products: Diesel fuel, gasoline, technical gases, fuel oils, lubricants and residues such as bitumen are modelled with a parameterised country-specific refinery model. The refinery model represents the current national standard in refining techniques (e.g. emission level, internal energy consumption, etc.) as well as the individual country-specific product output spectrum, which can be quite different from country to country.

Not included is the production of the aluminium extrusion profile, which should be calculated separately. Anodizing is an electrolytic passivation process which increases the thickness of a natural oxide layer on surface of a metal part. The metal is cleaned with a cleaning agent and etched with sodium hydroxides or acids. To grow the aluminium, an electrolysis takes place. Direct current is passed through an electrolytic solution, the aluminium serves as an anode. The cathode consists of carbon, lead, nickel, stainless or other material which is unreactive during the electrolysis. The cathode produces hydrogen, the aluminium anode oxygen forming aluminium oxide. The electrolytic solution chosen depends on which kind of oxide layer has to be produced. Barrier oxide is grown in almost neutral solutions where aluminium oxide is hardly soluble, porous oxide in acidic solutions in which the oxide can also be dissolved. The most widely used solution is dilute sulphuric acid.",en,This product can be used in construction.,en,generic dataset,1.0,1.0,Square meter,Sphera Solutions GmbH,e9920105-0f1a-4452-9a08-47289dc04116_20.21.060.xml,{'A1-A3': 5.73104326991599},5.73104326991599,5.7310433

Cork linoleum flooring consists mainly of linseed oil, natural resins, cork flour, pigments and jute.  Background system: Electricity: Electricity is modelled according to the individual country-specific situations. The country-specific modelling is achieved on multiple levels. Firstly, individual energy carrier specific power plants and plants for renewable energy sources are modelled according to the current national electricity grid mix. Modelling the electricity consumption mix includes transmission / distribution losses and the own use by energy producers (own consumption of power plants and ""other"" own consumption e.g. due to pumped storage hydro power etc.), as well as imported electricity. Secondly, the national emission and efficiency standards of the power plants are modelled as well as the share of electricity plants and combined heat and power plants (CHP). Thirdly, the country-specific energy carrier supply (share of imports and / or domestic supply) including the country-specific energy carrier properties (e.g. element and energy content) are accounted for. Fourthly, the exploration, mining/production, processing and transport processes of the energy carrier supply chains are modelled according to the specific situation of each electricity producing country. The different production and processing techniques (emissions and efficiencies) in the different energy producing countries are considered, e.g. different crude oil production technologies or different flaring rates at the oil platforms. Thermal energy, process steam: The thermal energy and process steam supply is modelled according to the individual country-specific situation with regard to emission standards and considered energy carriers. The thermal energy and process steam are produced at heat plants. Efficiencies for thermal energy production are by definition 100% in relation to the corresponding energy carrier input. For process steam the efficiency ranges from 85%, 90% to 95%. The energy carriers used for the generation of thermal energy and process steam are modelled according to the specific import situation (see electricity above). Transports: All relevant and known transport processes are included. Ocean-going and inland ship transport as well as rail, truck and pipeline transport of bulk commodities are considered. Energy carriers: The energy carriers are modelled according to the specific supply situation (see electricity above). Refinery products: Diesel fuel, gasoline, technical gases, fuel oils, lubricants and residues such as bitumen are modelled with a parameterised country-specific refinery model. The refinery model represents the current national standard in refining techniques (e.g. emission level, internal energy consumption, etc.) as well as the individual country-specific product output spectrum, which can be quite different from country to country.

The first step in the production of Kaiflex HFplus s2 is to mix the raw materials in a kneader and to roll out the resulting mixture which is then cut into sheets. The flat sheets are passed through an industrial cooler and cooled off. The cooled-off sheets are granulated and the granulates are temporarily stored at room temperature before entering the compounding plant. In a next step, the different types of granulates enter the compounding plant for mixing. The resulting elastomer compound is pushed through one of five extruders and carried on a conveyer belt through an industrial furnace for foaming. After foaming, the endless sheets are passed through an industrial cooler upon which a continuous longitudinal cut is applied to cut sheets into the right width. If applicable, adhesive coating is applied on one side of the sheets. Finally, a traverse cut trims the continuous sheet into sheets of various sizes.

Results are depicted in modules that allow the structured expression of results over the entire life cycle.,No,en,"Usually, EPS particles are produced for fillings by grinding production waste (for example from EPS plate production). Since the price differences per unit of volume  for EPS plates and EPS filling are negligibly small, no economic allocation of the environmental burden between main product and by-product was applied.

Background system: Electricity: Electricity from renewable and non- renewable powerplants is modelled so that it represents a countrys specific consumption mix including transmission / distribution losses, own consumption, imports, emissions and efficiency standards, and energy carrier properties. Several factors are taken into account. (1) Energy carrier production - The exploration, mining / production, processing, and transportation of energy carrier supply chains are modelled for each country. The models account for differences among countries in production and processing, including crude oil production technologies, flaring rates, production efficiencies, emissions, etc. (2) Energy carrier supply - Each countrys specific energy carrier supply is modelled, taking into account domestic supply versus imports from abroad. Energy carrier properties (e.g. carbon and energy content), which can vary depending from where an energy carrier is sourced, are adjusted accordingly. (3) Power plants - Models are created to represent energy carrier-specific power plants and electricity generation facilities specific to different renewable energy resources. Energy carrier production and supply models are used to represent power plant inputs. Combined heat and power (CHP) plants are also considered. (4) Electricity grid - Models representing the electricity generation facilities are combined into a larger model that reflects a countrys consumption mix. The larger model accounts for a countrys production mix, internal consumption (e.g. pumped storage for hydro power), transmission / distribution losses, and imported electricity. The country model is also adjusted according to national power plant emission and efficiency standards, as well as the countrys share of electricity plants versus CHP facilities. Thermal energy, process steam: The thermal energy and process steam supply is modelled to reflect each countrys emission standards and typical energy carriers (e.g., coal, natural gas, etc.) Both thermal energy and process steam are assumed to be produced at heat plants. Thermal energy datasets assume energy carrier inputs are converted to thermal energy with 100% efficiency; process steam datasets assume conversion efficiencies of 85%, 90% to 95%.

Mineral wool is made of sedimentary or igneous rocks (mainly basalt) and various recycled materials. The material is melted in the melting furnaces at 1400-1500 ° C and passed through rapidly rotating rollers. Binding agent is added. The binder then hardens in continuously operated tunnel kilns. For the glass wool a pure primary glass is melted in a furnace at about 1400 ° C. This process consumes power. The molten gluss is centrifuged in a perforated rotating drum. The warm airflow evaporates the water and the fibers solidify. The raw fibers are guided through a treadmills and a tunnel kiln. The binder cures at about 200 ° C.

Results are depicted in modules that allow the structured expression of results over the entire life cycle.,No,en,"The rigid PUR foam is used as insulation material and has a density of 32 kg per m3.   It is produced by continually filling the mixed raw materials iso cyanide, polyole and blowing agent into a form covered with paper. After the foam has frothed and partly hardened, the paper is pulled out and disposed. The block is cut to the favoured size and milled to the exact size. Also the discs are stacked and packed. They are not laminated.    It is expected, that the recycling quote of big appliances like boilers, air conditioning, and ventilation systems is 95%. For pipes or cables which are often flush-mounted a 90% recycling quote is expected. The quotes are only related to metals and plastics. For mineral materials like mineral wool, concrete or ceramics inert landfilling is assumed, as well as for 5-10% of metals and plastics (e.g. cable waste and pipe pieces) that are not recycled. Plastics that are not recycled are introduced to the municipal waste incineration. For the MWI a European model with average emission values and energy production rates was used. Depending on the incinerated type of plastic, different processes with corresponding elemental compositions were used. Then dataset were set up in collaboration with the Confederation of European Waste-to-Energy Plants (CEWEP) and are available on the website of the European Platform on LCA [EC 2008]. Power and thermal energy produced in the MWI are accounted to the European power- and thermal energy mix. The credits for the metal recycling and the energetic recovery of plastics, as well as the emission and resource consumptions (energy for remelting, incineration emissions, landfilling) are included in the datasets. Iron materials (steel sheet, pipes, grey cast iron) already use a share of steel scrap at the production. These values are deducted from the recycled steel material before introduced to the melting to avoid a overvaluation of the credits. For the credits primary steel was used. Credits for the recycling of rare earth or mercury emissions from fluorescent lamps are not considered due to a lack of information.

The first step in the production of Kaiflex KKplus s2 is to mix the raw materials in a kneader and to roll out the resulting mixture which is then cut into sheets. The flat sheets are passed through an industrial cooler and cooled off. The cooled-off sheets are granulated and the granulates are temporarily stored at room temperature before entering the compounding plant. In a next step, the different types of granulates enter the compounding plant for mixing. The resulting elastomer compound is pushed through extruders and carried on a conveyer belt through an industrial furnace for foaming. After foaming, the endless sheets are passed through an industrial cooler upon which a continuous longitudinal cut is applied to cut sheets into the right width. If applicable, adhesive coating is applied on one side of the sheets. Finally, a traverse cut trims the continuous sheet into sheets of various sizes. For the packaging, cardboard, polyethylene film, polypropylene film, and wooden pallets are used.

SwissPorit / MasterProtect NFF 2070 IN boards are an inorganic insulation material consisting of an inorganic binder and inorganic fillers. It is an easy to process material for light, non-flammable and thermally insulating as well as completely recyclable products used in the construction industry.   MasterProtect NFF 2070 IN has been specially developed for permanent, energy-efficient and heat-insulating prefabrication and construction site applications.     At high, medium and low densities, the product is frost-resistant and shows little water absorption because it has a high proportion of closed pores. Furthermore, it has a high level of stability when exposed to cyclical temperature and humidity.   The product is manufactured in a chemical foaming process (reaction of hydrogen peroxide and a catalyst to form water and oxygen). This can be carried out continuously or in a batch process.     For the use of the product, the respective national regulations at the place of use apply, in Germany for example the building regulations of the federal states, and the technical regulations based on these regulations.",No,en,"The production of the insulation material is divided in two steps: 1.Manufacturing of the compound (compounding) In this production step the raw materials of the (foam-able) compound are mixed.

All activities related to step 1 of the manufacturing process are allocated to module A1 (raw material supply, transport of raw materials etc.). 2.Manufacturing of the insulation foam (foaming) Once the compound is produced it is transported to clients. To manufacture the insulation foam, the dry compound is mixed with water and hydrogen peroxide. Through a chemical reaction of hydrogen peroxide with other reactive ingredients Oxygen occurs, which serves as foaming agent. At this point the “raw-foam” is formed. After 14 days curing time, the foam can be used as building material. The transport of the compound is allocated to module A2. The foaming and curing process itself is allocated to module A3.

Background system: Electricity: Electricity from renewable and non- renewable powerplants is modelled so that it represents a countrys specific consumption mix including transmission / distribution losses, own consumption, imports, emissions and efficiency standards, and energy carrier properties. Several factors are taken into account. (1) Energy carrier production - The exploration, mining / production, processing, and transportation of energy carrier supply chains are modelled for each country. The models account for differences among countries in production and processing, including crude oil production technologies, flaring rates, production efficiencies, emissions, etc. (2) Energy carrier supply - Each countrys specific energy carrier supply is modelled, taking into account domestic supply versus imports from abroad. Energy carrier properties (e.g. carbon and energy content), which can vary depending from where an energy carrier is sourced, are adjusted accordingly. (3) Power plants - Models are created to represent energy carrier-specific power plants and electricity generation facilities specific to different renewable energy resources. Energy carrier production and supply models are used to represent power plant inputs. Combined heat and power (CHP) plants are also considered. (4) Electricity grid - Models representing the electricity generation facilities are combined into a larger model that reflects a countrys consumption mix. The larger model accounts for a countrys production mix, internal consumption (e.g. pumped storage for hydro power), transmission / distribution losses, and imported electricity. The country model is also adjusted according to national power plant emission and efficiency standards, as well as the countrys share of electricity plants versus CHP facilities. Thermal energy, process steam: The thermal energy and process steam supply is modelled to reflect each countrys emission standards and typical energy carriers (e.g., coal, natural gas, etc.) Both thermal energy and process steam are assumed to be produced at heat plants.

In the first step, a homogenous compound is produced with rubber, additives, ancillary materials, blowing and vulcanization agents. This is done on the rolling mill or in the internal mixer followed by the rolling mill. Rubber extruders are used to process the compounds to produce raw profiles with defined dimensions. Here exact compliance with the dimensions for the raw profile is crucial for the dimensional accuracy of the foamed product. In the case of the discontinuous, pressureless production process, the raw profiles are cut to length and then foamed in a hot-air oven. In the case of the continuous, pressureless process, the extruded profile is fed directly onto a vulcanization line whose energy source may be hot air, for example. In foam production, vulcanization and blowing processes run alongside each other. Both reactions are regulated by temperature control.

The fibres are being impregnated and made into plates or fleeces from urea formaldehyde resin. The resin bakes afterwards in a continuous tunnel furnace. Insulation board: The board is built of 2 layers. It consists of a base layer and a so called ""cover"" layer. The average density is between 140 kg/mm3 (total thickness of 180 mm) and 162 kg/m3 (thickness = 60 mm). This board is used for insulation of non ventilated roofing. The data sets are created per m3 of product for the different thicknesses. Insulation felt: The insulation felt has an average density of 28 kg/ m3. It is used for insulation between the rafters of a pitched roof. The data sets are created per kg and can be used for different thicknesses. Heating tube shell: The heating tube shell consists of concentric rolled rockwool to insulate heating- and hot water pipes. The heating tube shell is concealed with a gridded reinforced aluminium sandwich foil. The data sets are representing 1 m of heating tube shell. The reference flow is given in mass unit. Rock wool netting wire mat:  The rock wool netting wire mat is an elastic mat made of rockwool and with a wire netting on one side for insulation of pipes and boilers.

The country-specific modelling is achieved on multiple levels. Firstly, individual energy carrier specific power plants and plants for renewable energy sources are modelled according to the current national electricity grid mix. Modelling the electricity consumption mix includes transmission / distribution losses and the own use by energy producers (own consumption of power plants and ""other"" own consumption e.g. due to pumped storage hydro power etc.), as well as imported electricity. Secondly, the national emission and efficiency standards of the power plants are modelled as well as the share of electricity plants and combined heat and power plants (CHP). Thirdly, the country-specific energy carrier supply (share of imports and / or domestic supply) including the country-specific energy carrier properties (e.g. element and energy content) are accounted for. Fourthly, the exploration, mining/production, processing and transport processes of the energy carrier supply chains are modelled according to the specific situation of each electricity producing country. The different production and processing techniques (emissions and efficiencies) in the different energy producing countries are considered, e.g. different crude oil production technologies or different flaring rates at the oil platforms. Thermal energy, process steam: The thermal energy and process steam supply is modelled according to the individual country-specific situation with regard to emission standards and considered energy carriers. The thermal energy and process steam are produced at heat plants. Efficiencies for thermal energy production are by definition 100% in relation to the corresponding energy carrier input. For process steam the efficiency ranges from 85%, 90% to 95%. The energy carriers used for the generation of thermal energy and process steam are modelled according to the specific import situation (see electricity above). Transports: All relevant and known transport processes are included. Ocean-going and inland ship transport as well as rail, truck and pipeline transport of bulk commodities are considered. Energy carriers: The energy carriers are modelled according to the specific supply situation (see electricity above). Refinery products: Diesel fuel, gasoline, technical gases, fuel oils, lubricants and residues such as bitumen are modelled with a parameterised country-specific refinery model. The refinery model represents the current national standard in refining techniques (e.g. emission level, internal energy consumption, etc.) as well as the individual country-specific product output spectrum, which can be quite different from country to country.
